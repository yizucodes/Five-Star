It sounds very nice overall and keeps its precision well as you turn up the volume.  It's not audiophile quality, but it's darn good, certainly fine, very nice in this price range.PositivesIt's easy to grip, and has a nice rubber like texture that feels soft and nice to hold.It's small - it's 6 inches long and should fit easily in a purse.Mine weighs in right at one pound, so it won't add much to your carry on weight or your purse weightVery good bass response - it really sounds great with dance music, pop, and metalIt pairs easily - I had fast, effortless pairing with my Android phoneThe streaming range is good - it's pretty much like most of these speakers- if I'm in the same room, or just right out of it, it works fine.The controls are on the top- they are very intuitiveIt has an on/off switch and there's no 'cool' voice that gets really annoying after you've heard it 40 times.  You just get a quick tone to let you know it's on.  That's really nice.It has an auxiliary jack in case you don't want to use Bluetooth.  My son likes to use it with his MP3 player with a cord to the speaker.It charges with the same miniport charger that my android phone and Kindle use.Everything needed comes in the box- cords, ect.It has an USB jack so you can use it as an external battery if needed.  That's a feature that is fairly unique.It's pretty loud - it won't blast you out, but it has enough sound to fill a room.My teenager loves it.  There's something about it that doesn't seem as intimidating as some of my other speakers like this.The charge time is several hours, even at loud volume.NegativesThe charge time is adequate, but is not as long as my Jawbone Jambox.  The sound quality is very good, yet not quite audiophile - if you want these two things, you're probably going to pay at least triple this price though.It's a bit bass heavy for watching movies, listening to voice, or some forms of music with more treble.  The higher frequencies are a bit muddy with classical piano, for instance.I was provided a free sample for my honest opinion.  It's a good speaker with nice features for its price range.The controls look nice,and are easy to click, but they are under the rubber, and in low lighting, it's hard to see them.",4,"Punchy bass, small size, big sound",1406073600,"07 23, 2014",7/23/2014,ive got several of these bluetooth speakers now in every price range and at the current price for this one i think it is an excellent offeringits got a really nice bass response and its great in the midrange with acceptable high range it sounds very nice overall and keeps its precision well as you turn up the volume its not audiophile quality but its darn good certainly fine very nice in this price rangepositivesits easy to grip and has a nice rubber like texture that feels soft and nice to holdits small its inches long and should fit easily in a pursemine weighs in right at one pound so it wont add much to your carry on weight or your purse weightvery good bass response it really sounds great with dance music pop and metalit pairs easily i had fast effortless pairing with my android phonethe streaming range is good its pretty much like most of these speakers if im in the same room or just right out of it it works finethe controls are on the top they are very intuitiveit has an onoff switch and theres no cool voice that gets really annoying after youve heard it times you just get a quick tone to let you know its on thats really niceit has an auxiliary jack in case you dont want to use bluetooth my son likes to use it with his mp player with a cord to the speakerit charges with the same miniport charger that my android phone and kindle useeverything needed comes in the box cords ectit has an usb jack so you can use it as an external battery if needed thats a feature that is fairly uniqueits pretty loud it wont blast you out but it has enough sound to fill a roommy teenager loves it theres something about it that doesnt seem as intimidating as some of my other speakers like thisthe charge time is several hours even at loud volumenegativesthe charge time is adequate but is not as long as my jawbone jambox the sound quality is very good yet not quite audiophile if you want these two things youre probably going to pay at least triple this price thoughits a bit bass heavy for watching movies listening to voice or some forms of music with more treble the higher frequencies are a bit muddy with classical piano for instancei was provided a free sample for my honest opinion its a good speaker with nice features for its price rangethe controls look niceand are easy to click but they are under the rubber and in low lighting its hard to see them,ive got several bluetooth speakers now every price range current price one think excellent offeringits got really nice bass response great midrange acceptable high range sounds very nice overall keeps precision well turn volume not audiophile quality darn good certainly fine very nice price rangepositivesits easy grip nice rubber like texture feels soft nice holdits small inches long should fit easily pursemine weighs right one pound so wont add much carry weight purse weightvery good bass response really sounds great dance music pop metalit pairs easily fast effortless pairing android phonethe streaming range good pretty much like most speakers im same room just right works finethe controls top very intuitiveit onoff switch theres no cool voice gets really annoying youve heard times just get quick tone let know thats really niceit auxiliary jack case dont want use bluetooth son likes use mp player cord speakerit charges same miniport charger android phone kindle useeverything needed comes box cords ectit usb jack so can use external battery needed thats feature fairly uniqueits pretty loud wont blast enough sound fill roommy teenager loves theres something doesnt seem intimidating some other speakers like thisthe charge time several hours even loud volumenegativesthe charge time adequate not long jawbone jambox sound quality very good yet not quite audiophile want two things youre probably going pay least triple price thoughits bit bass heavy watching movies listening voice some forms music more treble higher frequencies bit muddy classical piano instancei provided free sample honest opinion good speaker nice features price rangethe controls look niceand easy click rubber low lighting hard see,23-Jul-14,2487,451,Electronics|Portable Audio & Video|Portable Speakers & Docks|Portable Bluetooth Speakers,All Electronics,"Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker: Enjoy a high definition stereo sound with an impressive volume whether you're lounging around the house, or partying, walking out, camping, hiking, biking.

Highlights include the Advanced HAD CCD imager, which captures stunning detail and clarity, and 20x optical zoom with Super SteadyShot picture stabilization, which focuses on distant subjects, providing clear close-up images with less distortion. The Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens offers less glare and increased contrast for vivid, more life-like color and tones. Make your personal videos complete with additional customization features such as Picture and Fader effects for creative and professional looking enhancements. Picture Package software helps you easily organize and edit still images and video. 1/6-Inch Advanced HAD CCD Imager, 680K Pixels Gross 1/6-Inch Advanced HAD (Hole Accumulation Diode) CCD with 340K (effective) pixels provides stunning detail and clarity with exceptional video (up to 500 lines of horizontal resolution) and still image performance. MiniDV Recording Offers up to 500 lines of horizontal resolution, 3x the color bandwidth and a significantly higher signal/noise ratio, to provide spectacular video performance. 20x Optical/800x Digital Zoom The optical zoom helps to bring the action close up from far away. In addition, the digital zoom interpolation means that extreme digital zooming is clearer, with less distortion than previous types of digital zooms. Professional Quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens Carl Zeiss lenses have an advanced optical multi-layer coating that offers less glare and flare with increased contrast. This results in vivid image brilliance, true-to-life color saturation and perfect renditions of subtle tones. Super SteadyShot Picture Stabilization System Picture stabilization system that uses motion sensors to detect and compensate for camera ""shake"" without compromising picture quality like some other digital stabilization systems. 2.5-Inch Touch Panel SwivelScreen LCD Display (123K Pixels) Provides excellent viewing clarity with improved resolution. The high resolution 123K pixel LCD screen rotates up to 270 degrees for multiple viewing angles providing sharp, detailed images for monitoring or playback. USB Streaming Stay connected to family and friends by broadcasting live video with audio over the internet using the USB interface. You can even playback your favorite recorded scene on the camcorder's tape. It's like having your own video conferencing system. i.LINK DV Interface A digital high-speed bi-directional interface which provides audio-video communication between two compatible devices. This connection allows for pure digital transfer between devices equipped with an IEEE1394 interface, such as camcorders, digital VTRs, capture cards, and PCs. Digital Still Memory Mode with Memory Stick Duo Media Capture still images at 640 x 480 resolution, directly onto Memory Stick Duo Media for easy transfer to PCs for e-mailing, printing, or sharing with other compatible Memory Stick devices. InfoLithium Battery with AccuPower Meter System Charge the battery at anytime because unlike NiCad (Nickel Cadmium) batteries, Sony's rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are not subject to a life shortening ""memory effect."" Sony's exclusive AccuPower meter displays the battery time remaining in minutes, in either the viewfinder or on the LCD screen. Tele Macro Function Useful for shooting close up shots, but without having the camcorder casting a shadow on the subject. Images shot in the Tele Macro Mode will have the subject properly focused with the background unfocussed so that the subject stands out. Super NightShot Plus Infrared System With Sony's Super NightShot Infrared System you can capture natural looking video, even when shooting in low light. Record subjects up to 20 feet away using the built-in infrared system, but without the overall monochrome color common with earlier low-light recording systems. Manual Focus Allows the user to manually adjust the focus of the camcorder using the touch panel. Manual focusing also allows the user to control the focus in difficult situations where either the environment or the subject does not allow the camcorder's auto focus to perform optimally, such as when shooting through a window or in a crowded environment. On-Screen Zoom and Record Controls For additional control of the camcorder, the DCR-HC36 features Zoom and Record buttons on the frame of the LCD screen. This allows the user more flexibility when holding the camcorder, especially in overhead or low angle shots. Stamina Battery Power Management System Using the optional NP-FP90 InfoLithium Battery, the DCR-HC36 can continuously record for up to 9 hours (viewfinder) or up to 7 hours (LCD) on a single full charge, providing extra long battery life. Program AE (Auto Exposure) Modes Program AE modes make recording easy even when filming in challenging situations.

A9DH6MLZBGUMO,B00J8ZJCUW,Jules,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I had to order two of these - The GLAZZ was so well packaged that it survived transit perfectly, but after taking it out of the box I accidentally knocked it off of the desk (before I had applied it to the iPad) and when it hit the floor, it landed on one corner edge just right and the blasted thing spider-webbed.  Yes....it really IS made of glass folks!I had ordered a cheaper film which I applied and used while I was waiting for the second GLAZZ to arrive, and that kept the dust and oils off of the screen while I was waiting for delivery of the replacement.  It did a fine job, but it smeared rather badly.When the replacement arrived, I carefully did NOT drop it onto the floor.  I removed the other film, which lifted clean without leaving any residue on the tablet.I used the hinge method to apply the GLAZZ screen protector - applying removable tape along one long side to be sure of the alignment first, flipping it back, cleaning the screen of any dust using more of the removable tape, then removing the protective film from the GLAZZ screen cover and laying the adhesive side down on the tablet.  This is a stiffer screen protector than regular films - when I flipped it over, it gently laid ITSELF down perfectly on the tablet - no air bubbles formed.  Period.There was one minute speck of dust at one edge that I missed, I was able to lift that edge easily and remove the speck without any trouble.  Again, the screen protector aligned itself perfectly with no air trapped underneath.  I've never seen such a freakishly easy application.But the real difference with this screen protector, and the reason I am happy that I got a second one after messing up the first one, is that despite being perfectly clear, the GLAZZ does NOT show fingerprints!  Once it is applied, it completely disappears onto the screen, protecting it without being visible.

A35HOUWHAYZZN6,B00J49ZH56,Hedera Femme,"[0, 0]",0.0,"3.5 starsThe last time I owned a PC was in 2005, and while the transition took several months (getting used to differences, understanding the layout, etc.), I clearly chose Mac over PC. I never had the blue screen, everything was user-friendly, and the whole feel of using my computers was smooth and simple. Lately, I had been curious about PC again after some frustrations with Mac (pricing, difficulty in finding some types of software mostly). I gave this computer a try, and while I still need to give it more time to fairly assess it, I still prefer Mac.The first thing I noticed was that it didn't come with Microsoft Office, which was very disappointing. I remembered always having that software with my new PC's pre-2005. I am not sure when they stopped offering this, but it was a key selling point. Macs come with their own software that is somewhat comparable, but Microsoft Office will always be my favorite, which means Microsoft has still been getting money from me all these years. My point here, however, is this: at least my Mac came with counterparts to Word, Excel, and Powerpoint with the computer. This one did not, which means you need to add about $200 to the price tag of this laptop.Thankfully, this computer does come with some other very nice features, like a large, beautiful, touch-screen display that lets you interact with the software in several ways. It would probably make more sense to allow the keyboard to detach, however, because you are always at an awkward angle with your fingers if using it as a touch-screen, especially if you have longer fingernails. Likewise, it is very thin and lightweight! The days of PC being a clunky and awkward counterpart to Mac are over. This is a very sleek piece of technology!The main issues as a Mac-user trying to get back into PC were these:-Not very user-friendly in terms of finding things on the home screen with multiple tiles of applications. It feels cluttered. Very Cluttered. On the plus side, with some time, it is customizable.-The track-pad/mouse pad is very awkward and cannot (as far as I could tell) be customized. It does not work intuitively at all, which means having to scroll and switch screens in a time-consuming and annoying fashion.-I have to find anti-virus software. (Yes, I am aware Macs can also get viruses, but there are other protections that make it a little easier to avoid. Knock on wood...)-It is not plug-and-play ready to work with my phone. I will have to do some research and post updates, but I am not sure how well it will work in terms of synchronizing music, calendars, etc.I am sure this is an excellent laptop for those already using PC, but for a long-time Mac-user, the transition is a little rocky. I look forward to working out the kinks, however, so I can be fluent in both! This thing has potential, and I want to learn how to use it.",4,Review from a long-time Apple user,1406073600,"07 23, 2014",7/23/2014,starsthe last time i owned a pc was in and while the transition

They kind of spring back in response to my pressing them and that feel great. I was told it has a mechanical feel, whatever that is, I do not fully know as I have never owned a nicer keyboard than this one. I feel as if I am for the first time in my life using a real keyboard, a very responsive keyboard and one that will last.The individual keys are very easy to read. The one I had was hard to see, as the keys were not as well made, not as bright. The only thing I do not like about the keys is that they themselves do not light up in the dark.You see, this keyboard has a three color back light built in. What that means is there are three choices of color and the space around the keys lights up to reflect that choice of colors you have made. You can choose from Red, Blue, and Purple. You can have just that one color or you may have the keyboard cycle between all three. Also, you can speed up or slow down the rate at which they cycle. A nice feature to be sure.The function keys all have a secondary function assigned to them. They control things like the volume, media and more. There are also the standard arrow keys which can have “WASD” reassigned to them if you desire. Just remember to switch them back or when you go to type a “W” you will get an up arrow instead.One of perhaps the coolest features of this keyboard is that it is waterproof. I personally have not tested this feature. Something about intentionally pouring water on my electronics does not seem right to me.

AFOLGDQBUHPKM,B00H3OYSHW,"Amazon Customer ""The Brat""","[0, 0]",0.0,"The New Trent Airbender Pro Bluetooth Keyboard case is an excellent case for those who want the laptop look and near laptop like performance for their iPad Air. Some of my thoughts are discussed below.My Thoughts- The case is well built and although it adds some bulk to the iPad Air, it is lightweight and provides excellent protection. You need to follow the instructions that come with the case to ensure a frustration free installation. If you want to remove the case from the iPad easily, just reverse the installation instructions. I had no problem installing, removing and reinstalling the case on my iPad.- The bluetooth keyboard is thin, beautiful and typing is easy and very responsive. Functionality and performance compare favorablly to my 15"" laptop keyboard. The keyboard connects quickly to my iPad and holds a charge for a long time. I am still typing on the original charge with no sign of easing up.- The star of the show is the arm that attaches the keyboard to the the iPad Air case. It slides in and out, allows you to rotate the iPad 360% to enhance your viewing of the iPad from vertical to horizontal. Once theiPad is fixed in the stand, the arm allows you to change the viewing angle to 45%, 90%, etc. In addition, you can easily detach the case from the arm and it functions like a handheld hard case.- The built in screen protector does a good job of providing protection to the iPad's screen and is very responsive to the touch screen feature of the iPad. I detected no difference in responsiveness when I tested the iPad with or without the the screen protector on. Note that there were some grids and bubbles when I first put on the built in screen protector. This problem was solved when I removed my old screen protector from the iPad and reinstalled the built in screen protector of the NT610KR. Grids, bubbles and streaks disappeared. The end result was a thing of beauty. Also, the new trent case was easier to reinstall and and the fit was perfect.ConclusionI rate this case 5 stars.I am very happy with the protection, performance and looks of this case.  The manufacturer put a lot of effort and thought into designing this case. The angles are smooth, the workmanship, ease of use and  the performance are excellent. The arm feature is revolutionary and functions excellently to provide viewing comfort, keyboard space and convenience (detachability) in a beautiful compact package.

The built in protective screen protector is great and works very well and responsive to the touch screen, its also super clear.

If so, meet the Olympus Tough TG-3. It’s incredibly rugged, yet boasts a super-bright f2.0 4x zoom lens, sophisticated features like next-generation GPS, Interval Shooting and time-lapse movie options, four variable macro shooting modes, and system accessories that further expand its capabilities. This is the camera you take to places you never dared take a camera before.|So Rugged We Call It “Lifeproof” Extreme pursuits in extreme conditions require an extremely rugged camera. The TG-3 stands up to the four major challenges facing any adrenaline-crazed adventure shooter: wet – waterproof to 50 feet (15m); cold – freezeproof to 14°F (-10°C); clumsy – shockproof to 7 feet (2.1m); and forgetful – crushproof to 220 pounds of pressure (100kgf). So whether you dunk it, leave it outside, drop it or sit on it, the TG-3 will handle the abuse and keep right on capturing your epic adventures.|High-speed, Bright f2.0 Optics for Superb Low-light Shooting Shooting fast action in less-than-ideal lighting is a recipe for disappointment with most outdoor cameras – but not the TG-3. Its ultra-bright high-speed f2.0 lens enables the camera to dial up the shutter speed to nail blur-free shots when a school of exotic fish is passing by or your buddy is flashing through the shadows on his bike. You can also reduce the ISO to shoot crisp, detailed images with minimal noise in low light, or use the Aperture priority mode to expand the focus range of the background.|Built-in Connectivity for Your “Smart” Lifestyle The TG-3 is designed to meld seamlessly with your ever-more-interconnected digital world. WiFi is built right in, so you can share files easily with the Olympus Image Share app; even cooler, you can operate the zoom, adjust ISO and white balance, select the shooting and drive modes, activate the self-timer, and even select the autofocus point and trip the shutter, all from your smart device – great for wildlife photography and including yourself in group shots. The TG-3 also has a built-in electronic compass and next-generation GPS that accurately locates your position in 10 seconds and geotags photos (for mapping out your journeys).|(1) Location/landmarks|(2) Electronic compass|(3) Air pressure/altitude|(1) Location/landmarks|(2) Latitude/longitude|(3) Air pressure/Water pressure|(4) Altitude/water depth|(5) Date and time|(6) Location/landmarks|Get Creative with Interval Shooting and Time-lapse Movies With the TG-3’s Interval Shooting function, you can set when you want the camera to start shooting (from 1 second to 24 hours), then select intervals from as long as 24 hours to as short as 1 second and snap up to 99 frames. These images can then be compiled automatically into a time-lapse movie lasting up to 10 seconds (720p at 10 fps).|Get Up Close – Really Close!Mountain panoramas are great, but sometimes you want to zero in on subtler forms of natural beauty (like snowflakes or dew). The TG-3 offers four different modes for macro shooting, including Microscope, Microscope Control (a maximum magnification of 44.5x is possible from a distance of 1cm), Focus Bracketing and Focus Stacking (in which multiple images, from foreground to background, are taken and the areas in focus are automatically merged into one perfect shot).|Expand Your Rugged System with Useful Accessories Another thing that sets the TG-3 apart from other rugged cameras is its family of accessories (sold separately). The waterproof fisheye converter (FCON-T01) gives you the ability to capture gorgeous wide-angle shots; thanks to the bright f2.0 lens, even dark underwater scenes pop. The waterproof tele converter (TCON-T01) increases the camera’s zoom capability from 4x to nearly 7x, and allows you to highlight the subject by blurring the background. And the new LED ring guide (LG-1) channels the camera’s LED illuminator for enhanced, even lighting during macro photography.|In-camera Special Effects – and Now Photo Story For those who like to spice up their photography, the TG-3 includes 11 built-in Art Filters that enable you to apply effects like Pin Hole, Grainy Film and Fisheye right in the camera – no need to transfer images to a computer for manipulation. The TG-3 is also the first rugged camera that includes Olympus’s much-loved Photo Story feature, which provides templates you can use to combine different perspectives on the same scene into one image.",Olympus TG-3 Waterproof 16 MP Digital Camera (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Olympus,,positive,0.8405,0.06782879818594105,0.2,positive

The high gloss finish does pick up fingerprints, but a soft microfiber cloth is all one needs for cleanup. The unit, itself, is light weight, takes up very little room and requires minimal effort and setup when moving from place-to-place. The speakers, visible on the frontside, are not 100% covered, so care should be taken when handling in said area.  The bottom, of the unit and the (included) Stand for IPad, have 4 slip resistant tabs each  -- which work out very well on a (dry) smooth surface.The Operation Manual (in English, French and Spanish) is easy (and fun) to follow -- graphics are large, clear and bright. Wording is concise. One quickly realizes that this unit is packed with lots of bells and whistles. Note: this unit cannot be used to talk over the telephone even when there is a Bluetooth connection made to a mobile phone.  The first thing one may wish to do is insert a single AA battery (not included) into the (included) Remote Control.On the Front of the Sharp HE DK-KP85P Audio Slim Micro System one finds a good sized Display Window with very readable text and indicators,  Audio CD Disc Compartment with sliding doors (when doors are open there is a deep blue light inside CD compartment), Speakers, Timer Indicator, Remote Sensor and Pairing Indicator.Topside, one finds the Docking Station for iPod or iPhone, Headphone Terminal, USB Terminal and 10 -- slightly raised -- clickable buttons: Volume +/-, Turning Down (Disc/USB/iPod/iPhone/Bluetooth Skip Down Button), Turning Up (Disc/USB/iPod/iPhone/Bluetooth Skip Up Button), Play or Pause (Disc/USB/iPod/iPhone/Bluetooth), (Disc/USB) Stop, Pairing, FUNCTION, Disc Compartment Open/Close and Power On/Standby.On the back, of the unit one finds a 5' AC Power cable with a polarized plug (one blade is wider than the other), two slots for mounting unit on wall (screws not included, but paper template is) and individual ports for the (included) AM Loop and FM Antennas and a 3.5mm Audio-In port.Following directions, Pairing with BlueTooth was Super Fast.

I found the abiltiy to attach my iPad to the cover case difficult and frustrating.  I contacted New Trent support with my problem and they replied with a YouTube Video on how to attach.  What bothered me most was I should be able to install my iPad with little if any difficulty and that was not the case.Now having finally attaching the iPad I began using the Keyboard.  I found the keyboard very very easy to connect, to use and without having to read the instruction booklet, was able to operate it fast and efficiently.  I had concerns about how long the keyboard would operate before running out of power and found that the charge time was more than acceptable.  The unit will shutdown automatiically left without use which is good, because that makes the charge time last longer.  Causing the keyboard to reactivate is rather simple.  Merely need to hold down the on/off key for several seconds.Other than weight, the unit is a bit heavy, I give the unit 5 stars.  That is because the keyboard is very very good.

A2XLOMIPWUIJST,B00H3OYSHW,"nhwhazup ""nhwhazup""","[0, 0]",0.0,"Design:  The design of this keyboard case  basically covers it all for a protective keyboard case.  The case itself is a two part case with an included screen protector on the front cover which fits into a TPU protective back case.  All the pieces come apart fairly easily for separation, if you want to just pick up the iPad and go.  You can also set up the iPad totally separately on a flat surface and type away.  The design is well thought out and covers pretty much everything you can think of.  It provides great protection, offers a variety of viewing angles and 360 rotation of the iPad.  However, there are a couple of things that could be better.  The tab at the front of the keyboard that holds it closed is annoyingly placed and I end up rubbing my thumb on the tab when using the space bar  It is easily remedied by tucking it under the keyboard when working on a flat surface such as a counter or desktop.  When using the keyboard case on your lap, there is no way to keep the tab out of the way.  Another issue is that when you are carrying the iPad and keyboard from one surface to another in the typing mode, you need to hold both the keyboard and iPad or it is unstable.  It is fine if you fold it down in the regular carry mode.Set-up:  The set up was easy.  Took less than 5 minutes the first time, to clean my iPad and wipe everything dust free before assembling the iPad into the keyboard case.  Also, the bluetooth pairing was very simple.  I like that the pairing and on/off buttons are on the top of the keyboard.  Also, the indicator lights are placed on top.  This provides for easy viewing and simple use.  The keyboard automatically pairs up again when you turn it from off to on.Quality:  The keyboard case is made well with no manufacturing defects or flaws.  All the holes align well.  The included screen protector is actually very good - no loss of clarity and the feel for swiping is really decent.  Initially, I thought the keyboard felt kind of cheap but after using it - it is the best compromise to making the whole keyboard/case not super heavy.  The top iPad holder/protector is the heavy part of the case and the keyboard much lighter weight.Typing experience:  The keyboard is well laid out with a full quewty layout along with a top row of function keys.  The keys are chicklet style and have a good feel to them with good feedback for a nice typing experience.Overall this is a very decent, well thought out rugged/protective keyboard case.

When using the nRF24L01+ with an Arduino be sure to use the 3.3V output pin from the Arduino board to power the nRF24L01+ module. The module has 5V tolerant inputs which allows for direct connection of SPI pins to the Arduino. Ultra low power consumption as low as 11.3mA transmitting, 13.5mA receiving at 2Mbps, 900nA in power down, and 26uA in standby.  Internal filtering results in high margins of meeting RF regulatory standards. The modules radio uses Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation as well as fast Automatic Gain Control (AGC). The module includes an Interrupt Request (IRQ) pin which can be used to wake the host microcontroller, (ex: Arduino), from sleep when the module receives a transmission providing great power conservation in battery devices.

AFFVUZEGP1FDQ,B00H39MYXM,"Morrigan Alexandros ""The Opinionated Me""","[0, 0]",0.0,"I have been using these for a month straight. I mostly use them while on my bicycle. They are connected to my phone so that every mile, I can hear the stats of my trip (mph, time, miles, etc). I needed something that would not interfere with my ride or safety. This fits the bill a little.❶ IN THE BOX.  The earphones look sleek and great. The cords doesn't tangle all that, much, something I appreciate a lot. It comes in a nice box with several tips and a pouch. The box is entirely too big for these earphones. A lot of wasted materials.❷ COMFORT. This is where these earphones loses its stars. They are not that comfortable or easy to put in. The fit is weird, even with the smallest of tips, it doesn't fit well into the ear. This is likely intentional as it is not design to cover outside sounds (for safety). But, it is still uncomfortable. The top tip that sits in your cartilage area is VERY uncomfortable and it causes friction against your ear. Even though it has a rubbery cover, I find myself having to take the earphones out because it hurts! So, if you are working out for an hour, this might be ok, longer than that and ... just no.❸ THEY STAY PUT. The best feature that these earphones have is that they stay put. I have tried them whilst running or riding my bike and they have not fallen off twice. That ranks high on my earphone must have list.❹ PHONE CALLS. They audio and mic for the calls works very well. I have no issues. I only wish it had an in-cord answering button. If you are working out, you don't want to have to pull your phone out of your armband. A button would be perfect. I listen to audio books a lot and being able to pause the book without reaching for my phone is key.❺ SOUND QUALITY. For the purpose (working out and being mindful of safety) this is good. The earphones will not seal into your ears, so you are going to lose a lot in sound volume as well as quality. The sound quality itself is ok. I was not expecting much, so I was not disappointed.❻ SAFETY. This is, after all, the idea of these earphones. They will not block out the outside sounds so that you can remain aware of your surroundings (and cars!). I can hear the outside world perfectly fine whilst wearing these earphones.These earphones are good for their intended purpose: allowing the person to be aware of their surroundings whilst working out outside.",3,"Good for working out, uncomfortable after long workouts and no button to answer calls or pause music",1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,i have been using these for a month straight i mostly use them while on my bicycle they are connected to my phone so that every mile i can hear the stats of my trip mph time miles etc i needed something that would not interfere with my ride or safety this fits the bill a little in the box the earphones look sleek and great the cords doesnt tangle all that much something i appreciate a lot it comes in a nice box with several tips and a pouch the box is entirely too big for these earphones a lot of wasted materials comfort this is where these earphones loses its stars they are not that comfortable or easy to put in the fit is weird even with the smallest of tips it doesnt fit well into the ear this is likely intentional as it is not design to cover outside sounds for safety but it is still uncomfortable the top tip that sits in your cartilage area is very uncomfortable and it causes friction against your ear even though it has a rubbery cover i find myself having to take the earphones out because it hurts so if you are working out for an hour this might be ok longer than that and just no they stay put the best feature that these earphones have is that they stay put i have tried them whilst running or riding my bike and they have not fallen off twice that ranks high on my earphone must have list phone calls they audio and mic for the calls works very well i have no issues i only wish it had an incord answering button if you are working out you dont want to have to pull your phone out of your armband a button would be perfect i listen to audio books a lot and being able to pause the book without reaching for my phone is key sound quality for the purpose working out and being mindful of safety this is good the earphones will not seal into your ears so you are going to lose a lot in sound volume as well as quality the sound quality itself is ok i was not expecting much so i was not disappointed safety this is after all the idea of these earphones they will not block out the outside sounds so that you can remain aware of your surroundings and cars i can hear the outside world perfectly fine whilst wearing these earphonesthese earphones are good for their intended purpose allowing the person to be aware of their surroundings whilst working out outside,using month straight mostly use bicycle connected phone so every mile can hear stats trip mph time miles etc needed something would not interfere ride safety fits bill little box earphones look sleek great cords doesnt tangle all much something appreciate lot comes nice box several tips pouch box entirely too big earphones lot wasted materials comfort where earphones loses stars not comfortable easy put fit weird even smallest tips doesnt fit well ear likely intentional not design cover outside sounds safety still uncomfortable top tip sits cartilage area very uncomfortable causes friction ear even though rubbery cover find take earphones hurts so working hour might ok longer than just no stay put best feature earphones stay put tried whilst running riding bike not fallen twice ranks high earphone must list phone calls audio mic calls works very well no issues only wish incord answering button working dont want pull phone armband button would perfect listen audio books lot able pause book without reaching phone key sound quality purpose working mindful safety good earphones will not seal ears so going lose lot sound volume well quality sound quality ok not expecting much so not disappointed safety all idea earphones will not block outside sounds so can remain aware surroundings cars can hear outside world perfectly fine whilst wearing earphonesthese earphones good intended purpose allowing person aware surroundings whilst working outside,22-Jul-14,2409,443,Uncategorized,Uncategorized,No description available,Untitled,Unknown Brand,,positive,0.973,0.2197093023255814,0.2,positive

Downloading with this is quick and painless with the 1 GB of RAM making access to the internet quick with no delay, and the lack of lagging continues while streaming in videos or listening to music. The display looks good, too, adding to all forms of media, be it movies or comics. For the price, the tablet has great specs, with the aforementioned 1 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, an expansion slot so you can add SD cards. It has a great feel, is lightweight, and looks sharp. I also like the new design when it comes to accessing your tablet, with functionality becoming even more streamlined. If there is one downside to the newer ASUS tablets, it has to be the cameras.

They dripping and spill many thingsI already explain above, I feel very confident let them play with it. (Just don’t get surprise UPS delivery man drop package you didn’t order, I learned hard way, make sure you deleted all Amazon and Groupons  apps, if you let them play with your iPad)Wife-before I get this cover, my wife use iPad air most of time and I didn’t get enough chance to use it and I was gonna get another iPad, but we have 3 tablets laying around our house…But, now she doesn’t use much as before, since cover weight heavier than previous cover, even detach with keyboard, it’s bit heavy to woman, I don’t have weight issue tho.2. Design: I studied Industrial design and design seems very unique and user friendly. Back of cover show Apple logo with protection vinyl. The grip feels handy and comfortable.3. Keyboard feels lighter than previous model 2.0 and overall much better craftsmanship.4.

Light weight cover-it’s much lighter than previous model, but still bit heavy for ladies, both cover and keyboard.2. Bad temper person – took me about 15 min to insert iPad into cover. Since it’s well protected, it’s little hard to install it, I’m moderate tech geek and it wasn’t not easy. I also took out the iPad from case and yes, took me well over 10 min.Since screen protector include cover, you MUST clean(finger print and dust..) screen and remove screen protector before insert. Otherwise you will end up remove case again, btw I did use two screen protector (didn’t remove old one) didn’t have any issue, but screen seems too dark.3. Power-on indicator light not show, sometime you don’t know keyboard is on, unless you type something.4. Heavy cover cause when attached to keyboard, screen won’t stay angle, unless you put on the keyboard.5. When you use keyboard, pulling out stand not easy, and mechanism should be more user friendly it’s similar to pulling out head rest in the car seat.6. Wish there is color choice other than black color. Overall, it’s great case for buck, I know it’s bit pricy too but you will get what you pay for.I will strongly recommend for family with kids and worry free,",4,Have a baby or kid?

Allcast and phone remote control (use Samsung app for 2013 tv's as Samsung renamed it) work great. The usual Blu-Rays, DVD's, Netflix and Youtube are quick and responsive as well. Definitely the fastest Bluray/Smart player I have used and it has good wireless connectivity. I usually hook these up wired, but right now until I get things situated, its wireless to the other end of the house. The connection drops occasionally, but not during a movie and comes back quick. Using wireless N on 2.4Ghz. Haven't tried 5Ghz, but my experience with most home routers on 5ghz hasn't been stellar.Like others mentioned its loud on disk insert or when first starting up before you get into an app. It seems to quiet down though when actually in the disk or watching video in an app. There still is noticeable noise when playing, but its less than the DLP tv's fan and I can't hear it unless right near the tv. Note that the competition also has similar complaints.Was also happy I got the BD-FM59B model so a free HDMI cable.

A18FLOC8YQY0P8,B00K7O2DJU,Eric T.,"[1, 2]",0.5,"As a big Sony fan and owner of the RX100M2, I was happy to see some features I wanted incorporated into the M3 which was the tipping point to me forking out my dough and buying this. Alas, I am disappointed.This camera does take excellent pictures and the F2.8 does well in low light situation when zoom all the way out. The ability to take 3:2 is new and the camera seems to process the picture lot faster. There are now new options for video recording format. Battery wise, it's near identical and the difference is non meaningful.  Size and weight between the M2 and M3, it's near identical. Both use the same battery and battery charger.The M3 EVF feature was one I was really looking forward to, but it's a big disappointment. Previously with my M2, I had an external EVF hooked up to it which works well but made the camera harder to carry. When you slide up the EVF the camera will automatically turn on, and when your done, you push it down and the camera lens retract and turn off. Sounds good? Not really. What Sony did not mention is that when using the EVF, not only do you have to pop it up, but you have to pull the EVF towards you to adjust the diopter EVERYTIME, else it will be out of focus. Can you imagine how inconvenience this will be? Sony should have put a small diopter dial. The other problem is that the EVF is so small it is very hard to make out any of the letters/numbers. In other words, I find the EVF practically useless..Another thing I came to dislike is the zoom. Initially I thought I would be okay with the 24mm-70mm but now I wonder why Sony didn't keep the M2's 28mm to 105mm and make it an F2.8.I'm still contemplating on keeping this camera and not sure.

Not really something you will slip into a pocket, but certainly light enough for backpack traveling.  The rectangular shape also will fit nicely into large purses.  I have uploaded a photo of the 10400mAh pack next to a PSP 3000 so you can get a relative sense of size.The packaging instructions specifically state it is compatible with:Various lighting Apple Products (but use the original Apple Lightning to USB cable) as well as a specific 30 pin adaptor provided for iPhone 3, 4, and 4S, HTC Phones, Samsung Phones, Blackberry, Motorola, Nokia (comes with the specific DC2.0 connector), LG, Sony, Google Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX and other kindles, and others such as the Nook Tablet, Portable WiFi, and the PSP (NOT the PS Vita).Although not listed in the instructions, the on-site description does state that this power bank is NOT COMPATIBLE with The iPod Nano, Samsung and Asus tablets and a few other sundry GPS/Bluetooth devices. Which is unfortunate as I have a Samsung Tab 3, and yes, I tried... and no, it does not work reliably with the Tab 3. However, I cannot hit on that as it does specifically state that it isn't supported. I also tried it out on an iPod Nano, which did charge to full, yet the LCD screen did not register the discharge rate. So take note that the few categories it doesn't support, they apparently mean it.Now in reference in particular to the PSP, this power bank does not come with the requisite 5v adapter, but USB to 5v charging cables for the PSP are available here on Amazon and will work with this power bank. I bought aData & Power USB Cable for Sony PSPand used it with this battery pack like a charm even while playing games or video on it.

And while the charging time for the tablet isn't nearly as fast as a direct connection, on the A2 connector, it's fast enough to make me happy.  This is the charger I would take with me on a trip.The X2, like the other Eachine chargers I've tried, comes with a USB to Micro B cord and three extra connector tips, a Mini B, an Apple, and what I believe is a Nokia connector.  It has a bright, easy-to-read LED display that shows you the remaining charge and which output you're plugged into (There's a 5V 1.0A and a 5V 2.1A.  The latter is what I use to charge my Kindle Fire.)  The display is activated when you plug in a device, or when you press the button beside it.  Press and hold  turns it off.  Press twice turns on the bright LED flashlight located just above the input, or turns the flashlight back off.Clearly a lot of thought has gone into Eachine's chargers.

This isn't one of those tiny little pocket size keyboards with keys that are so small that it is nearly impossible not to make all kinds of typing mistakes but at the same time it is slightly smaller than some of the other Bluetooth keyboards out there.  One of the guys I work with has another Bluetooth keyboard which is slightly larger than the Sharkk keyboard.  The Sharkk also has a very nice rechargeable battery that provides excellent battery life.  Though I don't really use it the backlight feature is a nice touch for those who need or want it.I could continue telling you about the features it has but those are pretty much covered by reading about the keyboard here on the Amazon site.  Of course I do think that customer feedback is important so anyone interested in purchasing the item can get good honest information about what they are about to put down their hard earned money for no matter what the price is.  Part of what I am trying to say here is don't be fooled by the great price as compared to some of the other Bluetooth keyboards out there.  I think this one is every bit as good as any keyboard costing up to twice it's price.  Sharkk makes great products and I believe that so much so that I decided to buy another of their products, the Bluetooth 4.0 boombox of which I will be posting a review about next.  I will just tell you that it will also be getting 5 stars from me.  If you need a Bluetooth keyboard go and get yourself one of these as I don't think you can go wrong.

It's durable and reliable.  I have used it in the classroom setting and have not dropped my iPad yet.  Amazing as I use a lot a gestures.Cons:  Can't believe I am saying this, but none so far.Overall:  Wonderful made product.  I seen may hand held ones, but very few with all the features included in this case.Below is a summary of my review from my first day of usage.----------------------CosmeticsLook: 5  The case material is sturdy and so far scratch resistant.Material: 4. I like the smooth surface and the polish design of the case.  Additionally, the leather hand strap doesn't get sticky from sweat or cause any irritation on the skin when use the device for a prolong time.Con:  Actually, I am still looking for one.

If I do, I update this here.Installation ReviewEase: 5 Attaching iPad to keyboard was a simple snapPortabilityWeight: 5 Since one of the feature's of the iPad Air is lightweight, adding the case did increase the weight.  With the NT611GR the weight addition is worth the protection the case provides.Usefulness: 5 The leather hand strap was very sturdy and useful.  In addition the rotating strap allowed me to view my ipad differently depending on the task at hand.  As a bonus the built-in stand was sturdy, I have used it on various surfaces and it does a pretty good job of standing up.

A23KDA686N6T4Y,B00JGGBBBG,Nick Alec,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I've had this for a month now. My impressions overall are mixed and i dont really know what purpose it is trying to serve.It is not a photo manager as it says, there are barely any such tools to really manage the photos you put on it. The Apple version of the app has some basic stuff like deleting photos and such. But the desktop version i tried (windows 8) has no such thing to manage or even view the photos on the lyve! I do like the fact that it doesnt delete the pictures from the uploading device. There is no way to backup the lyve so you definitely dont want to put all your 'eggs in one basket' as they say. But i suppose this might be annoying for some.So then is it a pretty digital picture frame? I guess that sort of fits, but its a pretty steep price for a picture frame; especially one you have no control over what it shows. It just goes through all the pictures you have uploaded onto it. I dont understand why i cant specifically choose what pictures/ albums i want shown on the LCD screen. Am i the only one who has photos they want to store but not show everyone that comes over to my house? So no, i dont think it properly qualifies as a picture frame either. Though i do think the hardware is very good quality and yes , the LCD touchscreen is nice and pretty as well but for the price that should be expected in my opinion.So is this a storage device that collects your pictures automatically for you from your devices? This fits best... but even then its not very useful because it only supports the 'latest and greatest' smartphone systems ( atleast android 4.1/ iOS 7 ). Otherwise you still have to manually upload your pictures via USB and that defeats the whole 'automatic' thing.

NAS was detected immediately, drivers, apps an manual  last a couple of minutes installing, and there was the web interface, it is slow I must say, but it’s very user friendly everything has a little help button that guide you quickly on setup.By default it's set to work in RAID0, one thing I like a lot is that RAID volumes does not have to be the same size, so with my two old hard drives I ended up with a 420GB RAID0 which is a relieve because for some reason 4TB hard disks are so very expensive now days, so I could save to purchase one, install it in the NAS, and then keep saving for the other one, and another two of 2TB for its USB ports (limited to 2TB per port and no hub compatibility, as afar as I read In forums and reviews). I easily created a share folder and started DNLA server and Bittorrent client. My Buffalo Router Can mount the NAS share as A CIFS so I can use its transmission for parallel downloads.Filling up the Share folder  was easy as well, it gives me 50MBs average with top speeds of 59MBs, that’s enough for me considering I will only use it for Media streaming through its DNLA server, I don’t have any trouble streaming bluray remuxes to my Panasonic smartv, plugged ina 500GB

The expansion capability makes me happy as I am able to store bigger files without worrying about the smaller internal 8GB memory.  Overall, for this price, I have very few complaints.  In fact, the screen may be the best I've seen in one of these smaller tablet computers.This little tablet feels pretty solid and beefy for what it is, the quality is obvious.The initial charge took me about 1.5 hours and the battery life seems ok...not great.  I've been playing with it since I received it and have had to plug it in once to recharge.  I didn't get the full 5.5 hours it promised, but I did get well over four hours.The print app works really well.  In fact everything I've tried has been stellar.  The camera takes nice photos as long as you have good light.  Low light doesn't work well.  The photos aren't high definition, which is fine for me.  I'm older and no one wants to see me in high definition.  For better pictures I simply use my iPad or phone.  The photos on this don't compare, but neither does the price tag.My greatest complaint, my ONLY complaint for this low price is the glaring absence of Bluetooth.  I've remedied that with a Bluetooth adaptor that transmits to my Bluetooth speakers, however if I didn't already own one that I use with my prehistoric iPod, it would have been another $40 investment.

A3SSBBEGNC7G07,B00IG54NXG,"James Strock ""Serve to Lead""","[0, 0]",0.0,"The Philips SB365/37 wireless Bluetooth speaker is excellent.First, it's incredibly easy to set up. The Bluetooth matching is seamless. The reach is quite strong. It certainly goes at least 30 feet. To some extent, it can even work through the separation of walls, though I found that the signal could be lost from one room to another. As a practical matter, though, the speaker is so light that there's no problem moving it from room to room.The sound quality is excellent. Philips has not disappointed in this. The bass is very good for a such a small speaker.Perhaps the most telling, recurring criticisms from some Amazon.com reviewers relate to the power supply.The speaker does consume batteries at a rather rapid rate. One might install rechargeable batteries. They tend to be expensive and limited in performance, so that's not ideal. Depending on your needs, it's important to understand that there's not a built-in recharge capacity as with some portable speakers.The practical effect of this is to limit the real-time capacity of this speaker as truly portable. Given the battery consumption, one would likely not want to deploy it for regular use outdoors or other places without access to electric outlets.The portability is also limited by the design and construction of the speaker. Its size is just large enough so that it would be pretty challenging to carry in a small bag or case. So, too, it doesn't strike me as sturdy enough to put through the rigors of travel.On the other hand, for regular use in a home or office, using an electrical outlet, this unit can be a good choice.In the end, perhaps one should factor in the various compromises that various speakers include: cost, power, design and construction, sound quality.For many people who use this Philips product in one setting, this can be a versatile, high-quality, low-cost speaker.If you want durable portability--including smaller size, tight design, rechargeable power, good sound--you may want to compare this with other options. They will generally have higher price tags.In sum, for the uses as outlined, this is a fine product.

A2YL0DG11VA95,B00AIRUOI8,Anonymous,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I admit, the reviews I've read about this thing were pretty great for the most part, so I was willing to spend the extra money to get something I knew was highly rated... but I have to admit, I'm not all that impressed.Firstly, the sound is great -- if you're sitting still.  I'm a runner.  And after reading reviews about how this holds into place and doesn't budge during a good jog, I felt this was going to be ideal for my needs.  Well... this things doesn't exactly hold into place like you may think.  It comes with 3 different attachments for both the in-ear piece, as well as the hook piece that holds onto your ear so it doesn't fall out.  After several attempts with different size combinations, I found what seemed to best match my ear size and shape.  I went for a run and within the first 15-minutes I'm already starting to fiddle with the thing.  It was pushed snugly into place (that is required to get the full bass and sound from the speakers, otherwise you lose all audio quality -- even if it's barely coming out) and during my first 15-minutes it started to slide out, thus causing my audio to lose strength.  So... as we who run have all had to do, I push it back in.  Now, mind you... the little hook piece that's tucked into my external ear folds is still where it's supposed to be, but somehow that has nothing to do with the inner ear bud that's pushed down into my inner ear.  So... don't be fooled thinking that they are somewhat connected.So... this little scenario goes on for the next 30-minutes (during my 45-minute jog).  Every 15-30 seconds or so I'm pushing it back into my ear.  On both sides, after the first 15-minute looseness.Also, there is a way to make the cable shorter by these little black plastic pieces.  You're supposed to somehow overlap them back and forth through the grooves of the plastic pieces... but let me just say, that was a ridiculous mess.  I finally figured it out, with very little help coming from the instruction booklet.  Also, once you loop the cable -- be prepared for it to stay that way forever until you pull the cable completely back off of them, because those little suckers don't allow any room to increase or decrease your slack.  I fought for a while with all of the pieces of this device -- the cable shorteners, the inner ear buds, the external ear clips -- and have to say it was NO where near worth the sound coming from it.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because, 1 - yes, the sound was actually very good when properly inserted, 2 - the lightness of the headphones is far superior to other such devices, 3 - connects up without any problems and also has the control switch on the headphones, and 4 - battery life is excellent.The reasons I disliked it are written above, but to recap, this device is complicated with assembly (inner ear buds, not so much).

I use this with my 3d projector for movies at my campsite and really like it .Pros: great picture quality, really great sound quality, easy to set up, works well with wi fi for Netflix or amazon prime has a nice smart tv interface.Cons: the remote control, I can not stress to you how touchy this thing is with regards to being in straight line of sight. I have an LG 3d tv and another 3d blue ray play as well and they all have the same remote issues. The units will work with the remote well but you need to be almost straight in front of it with the remote at the same height as the sensor. this is less than desirable for use at the campsite as the projector is rarely in a straight line from me which requires movement to fix.Overall : I think the pros outweigh the cons myself and was blown away by how well the sound system works for me considering the price range. I use this outdoors with a generator and have in the past had trouble getting a  quality sound that would drown out the generator noise, this unit does this with flying colors.

AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00IX6D0EQ,NF,"[1, 1]",1.0,"I should note that there are multiple keyboards offered here. This review is of the keyboard sold as ""Universal"" ""Ultrathin"" which is suitable for any device that supports a Bluetooth keyboard. Some other reviewers have talked about a backlight for the keyboard but this model does not have a backlight. You can select a backlit keyboard by selecting the ""Illuminated"" or ""Illuminated Aluminium"" [sic] choices in the Color selection above, but you'll pay more for that option. There are other choices, as well, that I recommend reviewing. Honestly, I think the manufacturer should have split some of these up into separate products on Amazon but that's their choice.The Zotech Universal Keyboard is an inexpensive, compact, well-built keyboard, suitable for use with an Apple, Android, or Windows phone or tablet, for situations where the on-screen keyboard just doesn't hack it. Anyone who needs to do some serious note-taking, document writing, or editing, will understand the need for a keyboard like this, as the on-screen keyboard quickly reveals its limitations.The keys are, as far as I can tell, full-width. They're shorter in height and they are definitely grouped closer together than a typical keyboard. You can touch-type on this keyboard, just barely, but you'll almost certainly make more errors than usual. Still, I have larger than average hands and fingers and I was able to achieve perhaps 75% of my normal typing speed. These are ""chiclet"" keys, without the full play of a conventional keyboard, but that's expected. The focus on a keyboard like this is making it as small and as light as possible and I think that, by and large, they succeeded.The full range of keys is here, including various multimedia keys, control keys, and arrow keys, with an Fn key to double up the usefulness of some keys (e.g., once configured for Android use, the Fn key plus the Down arrow results in a Page Down command). The manufacturer calls these keys ""whisper-quiet."" The keys are quieter than my full-size Microsoft desktop keyboard but I don't think I'd use that term. The keys do make noise when you're typing, particularly the space bar, but nothing that really bothered me. The build is solid, with a lightweight aluminum back that, thankfully, doesn't show fingerprints.I tested the keyboard with my Samsung Galaxy SIII phone and with my Kindle Fire HDX tablet. The keyboard paired up and connected to both without incident and I was able to use the keyboard in my web browser, in my email client, and in my notepad app. The biggest irritant for me was the size and position of the Right Shift key, which was moved over and shrunk to make room for the up arrow. I know why they did this (and I don't even really disagree with the decision) but it definitely put a bit of a roadblock in my path for true full-speed touch typing.One interesting problem I had was that the keyboard was small enough that I felt a little shaky typing with it on my lap. It works, but I had to be careful to properly balance it on my legs. With a laptop/tablet stand or using it on a desk, that wasn't an issue and that's how I'd recommend you use it. You can also buy a tablet case/stand that specifically supports a keyboard like this and that would work, as well.What did I like?- Small and sturdy, a solid build. This isn't a cheaply-made keyboard, as some of them are.- There are special operations, including multimedia controls, on the F1 to F12 keys.- The ability to configure the keyboard for use with a Windows device, an Apple device, or an Android device.- The ability to get a Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End key, something that is missing on some other keyboards.- Decent battery life. The manufacturer claims 100 hours. I didn't get that much but I was able to use it extensively for a week on a single charge.What didn't I like?- The Right Shift key placement and size.- No traveling case or bag.- No stand to tilt the keyboard for use on a desktop.- No indicator light to let you know that the keyboard is on. If you forget and leave it on after you disconnect from your phone or tablet, there is no way to tell, as you have no status light. I assume this was done to save battery life.Overall, I like this keyboard. It really is a solid alternative at a competitive price ($18.99 at the time I write this). It paired easily and worked as expected. The minor nits I noted above are fairly typical for this product type and I don't consider them to be real issues. If you're a real touch typist and you want to type at your full speed, you might want to consider a larger keyboard. For everything else, though, this is a good choice and I can recommend it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

A21EF0VWVUI71W,B00JGZQ17Q,Shawn,"[1, 1]",1.0,I cut the cable cord about a year ago... Since then I got Netflix for movies ($8) and hulu plus for shows I missed when they came on for lack of a DVR ($8). The last thing I wanted was to add another $15 for Tivo or $5 for simple.tv or tablo. I mean what is the point of getting rid of cable if you have to keep adding 5 or 10 dollars a month from 3 or 4 different services? My end goal is to eliminate hulu and just keep netflix using the Channelmaster to record shows as they happen. So far it is working great... Here are my pro's and con'sPros1. No monthly fee WOOHOO2. I can add whatever size storage I want to it or even TWO drives if I want.3. Works great with my Harmony remote4. Very slim design takes up very little space.5. Can record two shows at once.6. Connects straight to TV unlike Simple.TV and Tablo which need a Roku and an app to watch shows on TV.7. Can I mention again NO FEES? =)Cons.1. No wifi built in. At the price if you do not have a HD ( I already had one) and ability to hard wire to internet the price can easily go up $100 to outfit yours. Still there is no fee which you still come out ahead after a year.2. Program guide. Not as detailed as Tivo or others. I found some of the extreme FRINGE UNKNOWN stations in my area the guide is never right.. But for any channel I would actually watch they are accurate.3. No remote viewing via IOS or ANDROID or LAPTOP. Though I found this is not a gamechanger for myself it might be for some as all the other major players in the DVR game do have remote viewing.4. No ability to just record FIRST showings of a series so you have to go back and delete reruns.5. Overall the system is very simplistic. Lacks a lot of bells and whistles. More of a digital VCR with a limited guide built in.6. OEM remote had issues penetrating glass on my entertainment center. I use a harmony which worked great but I felt this might be an issue if I had to use OEM remote.7. TUNER. I have read reviews that the Tuner does not pick up some channels well. Though My DVR found 77 Channels which is 30+ more than my Panasonic Plasma TV was able to pick up with it's tuner.Overall I find this is a great option for people that want to DVR shows but do not want to get stuck paying a subscription service to do so. I REALLY missed being able to pause live TV and rewind to see things again..

A1VP1KVX7Y4PHQ,B00FEE7B1I,"James T. Barringer ""Just the facts, Ma'm""","[0, 0]",0.0,"I got this for myself but had gotten an iPad mini for my wife.  Hers is not the retina version.  It's clear this has a sharper image than the non-retina iPad mini -- in fact despite the fact this is not 1080, I'm not sure many people would  complain.  The colors are gorgeous, and it is a pleasure to watch videos on this.  The image is better than the non-retina, and not as good as the retina display, but it sure looks good to me and most people who have seen it.There are many things that simply make this a superior value to an iPad - boosting intermal storage to 64 gig from 32 was only an additional $12, versus the rip-off Apple charges for more storage -plus you can add a memory card, and have (micro) USB. i paid about $250 for this tablet, with 64 gig storage (SSD) 2 gig of RAM, and with USB access.  Peripherals are vastly more reasonable than with Apple.  My all-over case was only $8, while it was $40 for just a front cover for my wife's similar size iPad mini.Full MS Office makes it an even nicer deal -ALTHOUGH - am I really going to use an 8"" tablet as a productivity device?  This really is a full-on Windows 8 PC, which is an awesome idea, but in an 8 inch tablet, that may have limited benefit.The above are strong points vs iPad mini.  But on the other side, I have to say the iPad has less trouble with the touch capabilities, lots more apps (especially tablet native games).  Technically speaking, the Windows tablet can do a whole lot more because of the vast number of Windows programs, but I find it's not practical to use this tablet for full-on PC games.  It looks like it can functionally run them, but you need an external controller to play successfully.  This to me is an issue.That said, I'm personally trying to not be too invested in the Apple ecosystem (3 iPhones, 1 iPad and 1 Apple TV in the household, but lots of Windows laptops). But I have to admit the Apple iPad is probably best for those who are just looking for an easy, low frustration experience, and aren't so interested in playing with tech for tech's sake - and aren't tightwads like me!",4,"A great value, but not for everyone.",1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,i got this for myself but had gotten an ipad mini for my wife hers is not the retina version its clear this has a sharper image than the nonretina ipad mini in fact despite the fact this is not im not sure many people would complain the colors are gorgeous and it is a pleasure to watch videos on this the image is better than the nonretina and not as good as the retina display but it sure looks good to me and most people who have seen itthere are many things that simply make this a superior value to an ipad boosting intermal storage to gig from was only an additional versus the ripoff apple charges for more storage plus you can add a memory card and have micro usb i paid about for this tablet with gig storage ssd gig of ram and with usb access peripherals are vastly more reasonable than with apple my allover case was only while it was for just a front cover for my wifes similar size ipad minifull ms office makes it an even nicer deal although am i really going to use an tablet as a productivity device this really is a fullon windows pc which is an awesome idea but in an inch tablet that may have limited benefitthe above are strong points vs ipad mini but on the other side i have to say the ipad has less trouble with the touch capabilities lots more apps especially tablet native games technically speaking the windows tablet can do a whole lot more because of the vast number of windows programs but i find its not practical to use this tablet for fullon pc games it looks like it can functionally run them but you need an external controller to play successfully this to me is an issuethat said im personally trying to not be too invested in the apple ecosystem iphones ipad and apple tv in the household but lots of windows laptops but i have to admit the apple ipad is probably best for those who are just looking for an easy low frustration experience and arent so interested in playing with tech for techs sake and arent tightwads like me,got gotten ipad mini wife not retina version clear sharper image than nonretina ipad mini fact despite fact not im not sure many people would complain colors gorgeous pleasure watch videos image better than nonretina not good retina display sure looks good most people seen itthere many things simply make superior value ipad boosting intermal storage gig only additional versus ripoff apple charges more storage plus can add memory card micro usb paid tablet gig storage ssd gig ram usb access peripherals vastly more reasonable than apple allover case only just front cover wifes similar size ipad minifull ms office makes even nicer deal although really going use tablet productivity device really fullon windows pc awesome idea inch tablet may limited benefitthe strong points vs ipad mini other side say ipad less trouble touch capabilities lots more apps especially tablet native games technically speaking windows tablet can whole lot more vast number windows programs find not practical use tablet fullon pc games looks like can functionally run need external controller play successfully issuethat said im personally trying not too invested apple ecosystem iphones ipad apple tv household lots windows laptops admit apple ipad probably best just looking easy low frustration experience arent so interested playing tech techs sake arent tightwads like,22-Jul-14,2096,392,Electronics|Computers & Accessories|Computers & Tablets|Tablets,Computers,| Shop the Windows Store for the full selection of Windows 8 PCs|   ,Dell Venue 8 Pro 5000 Series 32 GB Windows 8.1 Tablet,Dell,,positive,0.9838,0.26163003663003664,0.0,positive

A4IL0CLL27Q33,B00IQ0SE0O,D. Brennan,"[0, 1]",0.0,"I currently use aYamaha YSP2200 132-Watts RMS-Wireless 7.1 Digital Sound Projector(Black)with my LG wall-mounted flat screen. I changed over to a sound bar because I was tired with all the wires running across my living room for the 5.1 surround system I had. The Yamaha's sound wasn't as good as a true 5 speaker system but it was good enough for me to enjoy movies and music from a wide range of sources.I swapped out the Yamaha in subbed in the Sharp for 2 weeks. At the end of the day the Sharp proved itself to be very good, but not as good as my Yamaha. That being said, the Yamaha retails for $800 - double of the price of the Sharp. So - if your budget is $400, the Sharp is going to make you happy. If you can stretch the budget, I would recommend looking at the Yamaha. The only potential deal breaker is that it only has 2 inbound HDMI ports so count your devices in advance.Here's some of the qualities I found relevant to my evaluation:1 - Volume: Yes, the Sharp can produce a lot of sound - way more than I could use in my apartment without permanent hearing loss.2 - Bass: You have to have bass is you're going to enjoy movies, and it's the main issue guys cite when they insist on having a full 5.1 surround system. The wireless sub woofer (which was completely foolproof to set up) produced very good, bordering on great, bass. I watched Transformers and Star Trek (2009) and was very happy with the bass. I also was more than satisfied with the bass while listening to The Dropkick Murphys and Midnight Oil.3 - HDMI ports and config: It used to be that HDMI was a pain to get working. Granted I basically had my wires all figured out for my Yamaha and simply moved them over to the Sharp, but the devices all worked without any significant configuration. I warn you though - you may have to buy THAT friend of yours a couple of beers to have him come over and set up the TV audio, your Apple TV, Chromecast and Xbox to work seamlessly if you are setting up your audio for the first time.You only get two inbound HDMI ports. FOr some people that is going to be a deal breaker. I'm a little spoiled as my TV has a bunch of HDMI ports so I can devices up to.4 - Digital Video - You have a standard digital video (fiber optic) port which worked fine with my television (I use apps like Vudu and Amazon, as well as a digital antenna for broadcast television).5 - Mounting - Mounting was super easy. Sharp was considerate enough to include a full-sized paper template that shows your install points for your brackets and screws. Tape it to the wall, make sure it is level and then drill away. This should be a standard practice for all sound bars but you will discover that most companies cannot be bothered to provide this common sense accessory for you.6 - Remote - the remote is simple to use and will let you easily jump between functions with a minimal learning curve.7 - Appearance - it's a good looking sound bar. If you use it for a tv smaller than 60"" you will have some overhang. The extra width spaces out the speakers a bit, which supposedly gives you more realistic 3D effects. I didn't notice that improvement, but that's probably because my Yamaha is VERY good as 3D sound even though it is a foot narrower.A couple of other things to think about:-The system takes a few seconds to power up and to catch up when shifting modes. It's not a problem, In fact, it will probably make life easier for you as it's due to the system jumping through some technical hoops to try to figure out what you are trying to do so that you may not even need to manually switch your audio sources.-The box is fairly large but the system itself is relatively light (most of the weight is the sub-woofer). The sound bar is much thinner and shallower than other sound bars that I have seen. It's a modern look that will work for most people.-I have not yet used the near-field communication set up but will update the review when I get around to messing with it.Overall this sound bar gets a solid, budget conscious, BUY recommendation. I'm holding off on a full 5-star rating but I feel a little bad about it. If there was an extra 1-2 HDMI ports it would get 5-stars. Perhaps that's an inevitable trade-off due to the price point they needed to hit.",4,A definite upgrade over your flat screen's internal speakers and a solid performer at its price

A3MFORLOKIOEQY,B00IVPU5BK,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I needed a larger SD card for my Canon M30, so I ordered this one to see how it works. I find it to be as fast as other class 10 cards, and about average for downloading the files.I prefer using the SD card for my Canon because it is faster to remove the card than to connect the camcorder to the computer via USB. I wasn't sure that this one would work (I'd not used more than 16 Gb before), but it works fine in my device. The recording went well, and there were no errors; I didn't notice any difference between this and my other Class 10 flash drives. I put the disc into an adapter and transferred the files to my computer, again without errors. Transfer back to computer is going to be dependent upon the speed of the port and adapter being used.

A3GW60N4R1WQWZ,B00EZSUVHK,Kevin Reid,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I bought this because I needed a monitor, any monitor, to use with a couple of devices with HDMI output. This monitor has overall done a good job for the price, but it has some quirks that you should know about before choosing it.Pros:• Works. No dead pixels.• Reasonably fast to wake up.• The “2” button is a one-press shortcut to switch inputs.• Power supply is internal (no brick on the floor).Cons and quirks:• No built-in USB hub.• The onscreen menu is handled by four buttons in a row: ""1 2 ↓ ↑"", where ""1"" is usually ""back/exit"" and ""2"" is usually ""select"". It's slightly tricky to remember which button to push, all of the ranged controls (like brightness/contrast) have to be selected and then changed and it doesn't display this clearly, and the ""Memory Recall"" function, which resets all settings, is in the main menu and has no confirmation so it's easy to press by accident.• Occasionally has a blip of static a couple seconds after switching source (not recurring, so not really a problem).• No built-in speakers; the only audio function is analog line-out/headphone jacks to split out any audio from the HDMI input. Has a volume control for that output in the menu.• Cannot be easily made dim enough for comfortable night-time use; there isn't much brightness range and what there is is tedious to adjust.• Stand has only a tilt adjustment. (When vertical, the height from the tabletop to the bottom edge of the image is 12 cm or 4.5 inches.)• When I connected it to a BeagleBone Black running Linux in text mode, the image was shifted downward about five pixels, so that the bottom line of text is partly cut off (can't see the cursor underscore). This may be a quirk of the BBB, or it may be that the monitor has trouble correctly aligning images which are solid black on the top and bottom edges (wouldn't think that would be a problem in pure digital inputs, though).Mixed-bag notes:• The clear plastic ring at the bottom center is a giant blue power light. It can be disabled in the menu. But it turns amber in sleep mode and this cannot be disabled.• Automatically tries other sources when one goes away. So if you have two computers connected and you put one to sleep it'll display the other one, which is convenient. On the other hand, it's terrible if you have, say, a Chromecast plugged in to the HDMI port (which *always* provides a signal). This function cannot be disabled.Complete list of ports on the back:• AC power in• Line audio out• Headphones out• HDMI in• DVI in• VGA in",4,Adequate basic monitor,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,i bought this because i needed a monitor any monitor to use with a couple of devices with hdmi output this monitor has overall done a good job for the price but it has some quirks that you should know about before choosing itpros works no dead pixels reasonably fast to wake up the button is a onepress shortcut to switch inputs power supply is internal no brick on the floorcons and quirks no builtin usb hub the onscreen menu is handled by four buttons in a row where is usually backexit and is usually select its slightly tricky to remember which button to push all of the ranged controls like brightnesscontrast have to be selected and then changed and it doesnt display this clearly and the memory recall function which resets all settings is in the main menu and has no confirmation so its easy to press by accident occasionally has a blip of static a couple seconds after switching source not recurring so not really a problem no builtin speakers the only audio function is analog lineoutheadphone jacks to split out any audio from the hdmi input has a volume control for that output in the menu cannot be easily made dim enough for comfortable nighttime use there isnt much brightness range and what there is is tedious to adjust stand has only a tilt adjustment when vertical the height from the tabletop to the bottom edge of the image is cm or inches when i connected it to a beaglebone black running linux in text mode the image was shifted downward about five pixels so that the bottom line of text is partly cut off cant see the cursor underscore this may be a quirk of the bbb or it may be that the monitor has trouble correctly aligning images which are solid black on the top and bottom edges wouldnt think that would be a problem in pure digital inputs thoughmixedbag notes the clear plastic ring at the bottom center is a giant blue power light it can be disabled in the menu but it turns amber in sleep mode and this cannot be disabled automatically tries other sources when one goes away so if you have two computers connected and you put one to sleep itll display the other one which is convenient on the other hand its terrible if you have say a chromecast plugged in to the hdmi port which always provides a signal this function cannot be disabledcomplete list of ports on the back ac power in line audio out headphones out hdmi in dvi in vga in,bought needed monitor any monitor use couple devices hdmi output monitor overall done good job price some quirks should know choosing itpros works no dead pixels reasonably fast wake button onepress shortcut switch inputs power supply internal no brick floorcons quirks no builtin usb hub onscreen menu handled four buttons row where usually backexit usually select slightly tricky remember button push all ranged controls like brightnesscontrast selected changed doesnt display clearly memory recall function resets all settings main menu no confirmation so easy press accident occasionally blip static couple seconds switching source not recurring so not really problem no builtin speakers only audio function analog lineoutheadphone jacks split any audio hdmi input volume control output menu cannot easily made dim enough comfortable nighttime use there isnt much brightness range there tedious adjust stand only tilt adjustment when vertical height tabletop bottom edge image cm inches when connected beaglebone black running linux text mode image shifted downward five pixels so bottom line text partly cut cant see cursor underscore may quirk bbb may monitor trouble correctly aligning images solid black top bottom edges wouldnt think would problem pure digital inputs thoughmixedbag notes clear plastic ring bottom center giant blue power light can disabled menu turns amber sleep mode cannot disabled automatically tries other sources when one goes away so two computers connected put one sleep itll display other one convenient other hand terrible say chromecast plugged hdmi port always provides signal function cannot disabledcomplete list ports back ac power line audio headphones hdmi dvi vga,22-Jul-14,2692,445,Uncategorized,Uncategorized,No description available,Untitled,Unknown Brand,,neutral,0.8058,0.01839569160997731,0.4,positive

A1V4VVBQBFXRHC,B00K91DB7Y,Big-D,"[1, 1]",1.0,"It was said this Linksys WRT1900AC was not only the biggest on the market, but the fastest and he most expensive. I am always on the look out for bigger and better technology, especially when it comes to the newest computer category. So when I saw this router being offered I jumped at the chance, although my current Wireless Router works just fine and allows everything I need. However, this being considered ""The Best"" on the market, I wanted it.Once I received my order I opened it immediately and I will say, it is a pretty large Router, placed in a really cool box with all of the accessories neatly stacked in the box making this appear like the manufacturer took a lot of effort to make sure you as the buyer was impressed. After all, first impressions are everything.I removed my current Router, loaded up the included CD-Rom included with this Router and went to installing it on my Desktop. Now I feel I should describe my desktop to some extent. I am running Window7Pro 64-bit with a Core I-7 processing chip, 32gb of Ram, twin 2TB Hard Drives, a Corsair HX Professional Series 850-Watt 80 Plus Certified Power Supply and a ASUS GT640 2GB DDR3 Memory Graphics Cards.Once I proceeded with installation, it was very easy and performed much of it by itself. That was the initial installation part. Then came the secondary installation where you can set it up to meet your needs and requirements. As soon as I finished and saved my settings (all of which are offered as options on the setup screen) it took a major dive. It died and even after 1.5hrs with Linksys Support, it was still dead. Trying to call Linksys was not an easy task, because the first number that was actually included with the Router was not in service, so I looked them up and tried several other numbers. I eventually found a support person to speak with, but during my first conversation I was told I would have to give them my credit card number and authorize a $279.00 plus related shipping and tax charges once any service was performed on this router. I first called them because at first I thought I may have installed it incorrectly and thought if that was the case, they would be able to talk me through it.I must add that prior to buying anything, especially online, I first read NOT manufacturers reviews, but reviews written by consumers that actual own the product I am interested in. Next to the product itself, Customer Service is equal to it in importance, because once someone gets your money and should you experience a problem, that is when the full truth will show through. And in this case, I'm sorry but Linksys failed my grade with a ""F"" in Customer Service. First, it took over an hour to get a hold of them after being bounced around from extension to extension, then I did get a very helpful representative that tried his best to help and eventually said the product was defective. In the end, I was told in order to have the product serviced, I would have to authorized a charge of $279.00 plus tax & shipping if I wanted it repaired. And then he said would replace the unit with a Refurbished unit, not a new one. I told him I wasn't concerned about replacement, but wanted to try Linksys Customer Service because that is part of a buying process in the event someone experienced a defective unit. I asked him that if I had asked for a replacement, why would it not be a NEW unit since this unit was in fact new and just recently released for sale to customers. He informed me that they had hundreds of units that had been returned due to being defective and replacing Defective units were replaced with Refurbished not new units.My responsibility as a Reviewer, is to offer a truthful, fair, non-biased opinion of products offered to me. Although this product was the first ever I had received defective, if I had ordered this directly from the company and received it defective, my review would include any positive or negative issues I experienced from the sellers Customer Service department, as I firmly believe the possibility of an occasional product being received defective is part of the Sales process and how the manufacturer

The woven-pattern carbon fiber body and aluminum frame are a distinctive combination and they feel  good in the hand.  The keyboard feels solid and is backlit.  The touch screen has a beautiful picture and is very responsive.  It flips effortlessly to tablet mode, with a two second delay for display reorientation.  The Samsung SSD gives a fast startup and the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM make it very responsive and speedy in use.There are a lot of thoughtful details, such as the power adapter that can be plugged directly in the wall or used in-line with a detachable power cable, an LED indicator for remaining battery capacity that can be turned off, a button to disarm the gyroscope, a sliding on-off switch, and a USB port designated for charging electronic devices.  Camera, microphone, speakers, touchpad, battery: all are high-quality components and work very well.The Mini DisplayPort allows painless plug & play connection to an external monitor.  However, when attempting to use an LG television as a primary or secondary monitor via WiDi, there were multiple problems, and I ultimately abandoned that effort after several wasted hours and software downloads.  That was a big disappointment, although it is simple enough to play media files on the television via networking and the  DLNA server software.There are some minor inconveniences.  When in notebook configuration, the screen sometimes flips unintentionally when touched near the top, and at other times the entire notebook tips back, as it is slightly top-heavy.  The only other concern is that the body and screen both smudge easily.  A microfiber cleaning cloth should be included with this device.Where this Ultrabook falls short is as a tablet, because it is awkward to handle.  There is really no way around this given today's technology, as it is primarily due to its weight, which is 3 lb. 5.3 oz. (1512 g), compared to an iPad Air, which weighs much less than a third of that.  This makes it uncomfortable to hold for long periods, despite the long ridges underneath that provide a comfortable grip.  The fingertips inevitably end up over the vents underneath and exposed to uncomfortable heat. The aluminum frame flexes separately from the screen.

New interfaces and multitasking demands require more from your system than perhaps ever before. From connecting instantly with friends and accessing apps, websites, and playlists online, to simultaneously streaming videos and downloading files, your computer is faced with an entirely new set of performance expectations that a hard drive struggles to meet. That’s where the Crucial M500 SSD comes in. With speeds dramatically faster than a hard drive, the Crucial M500 SSD isn't just a storage upgrade - it's a complete system transformation. From its nearly instantaneous boot times, powerful data transfer speeds, increased multitasking capability, and rock-solid reliability, the Crucial M500 delivers dramatic performance gains - all at an affordable price. |For businesses | Secure your data. Protect your customers’ privacy. Your data is your competitive advantage. Whether it’s the inside information on your latest product or your customers’ credit card numbers, information in the wrong hands has the potential to devastate your business. The best strategy for protecting your sensitive data is to implement a defense, one that includes top-level hardware-based encryption. The Crucial M500 SSD is a self-encrypting drive (SED) based on the rigorous standards established by the TCG Opal specification. Combined with applications like Microsoft BitLocker or Wave Systems’ EMBASSY Trust suite, our AES 256-bit hardware encryption engine (that’s integrated into the controller of the Crucial M500) allows the drive to operate at full speed without the performance loss that’s typically associated with non-SED drives using software-based encryption technology.|For all users | Consistently fast speeds. No exceptions. No matter what kind of files you’re working with on a Crucial SSD, you’ll experience high speeds with no drop in performance across different file types. Unlike other SSDs on the market, Crucial SSDs treat all files the same, regardless of whether they’re compressed or uncompressed. While many SSDs on the market achieve faster speeds by using file compression, many of the most common file types can’t be compressed, resulting in SSDs that often deliver slower speeds than advertised. This is important because the files most people use every day – videos, mp3s, advanced graphic files and zip files - are compressed files and thus unable to be compressed any further. With a Crucial SSD, the specs we advertise are the same specs you’ll see in the real world.|Crucial SSDs. Performance you can trust.  Crucial is a brand of Micron, one of the largest NAND manufacturers in the world, and we design and develop our SSDs in-house using state-of-the-art technology. This means four things: hundreds of SSD qualification tests, over a thousand hours of prerelease validation testing, 1.5 billion dollars invested in R&D, and more than 30 years of industry expertise. With our multi-billion dollar commitment to NAND development, our record of patent and process innovation, and our award-winning customer support team, we’re dedicated to quality.  For you, that means your SSD has been designed with cutting-edge technology and it’s been rigorously tested and approved.

From its nearly instantaneous boot times, powerful data transfer speeds, increased multitasking capability, and rock-solid reliability, the Crucial M500 delivers dramatic performance gains - all at an affordable price. |For businesses | Secure your data. Protect your customers’ privacy. Your data is your competitive advantage. Whether it’s the inside information on your latest product or your customers’ credit card numbers, information in the wrong hands has the potential to devastate your business. The best strategy for protecting your sensitive data is to implement a defense, one that includes top-level hardware-based encryption. The Crucial M500 SSD is a self-encrypting drive (SED) based on the rigorous standards established by the TCG Opal specification. Combined with applications like Microsoft BitLocker or Wave Systems’ EMBASSY Trust suite, our AES 256-bit hardware encryption engine (that’s integrated into the controller of the Crucial M500) allows the drive to operate at full speed without the performance loss that’s typically associated with non-SED drives using software-based encryption technology.|For all users | Consistently fast speeds. No exceptions. No matter what kind of files you’re working with on a Crucial SSD, you’ll experience high speeds with no drop in performance across different file types. Unlike other SSDs on the market, Crucial SSDs treat all files the same, regardless of whether they’re compressed or uncompressed. While many SSDs on the market achieve faster speeds by using file compression, many of the most common file types can’t be compressed, resulting in SSDs that often deliver slower speeds than advertised. This is important because the files most people use every day – videos, mp3s, advanced graphic files and zip files - are compressed files and thus unable to be compressed any further. With a Crucial SSD, the specs we advertise are the same specs you’ll see in the real world.|Crucial SSDs. Performance you can trust.  Crucial is a brand of Micron, one of the largest NAND manufacturers in the world, and we design and develop our SSDs in-house using state-of-the-art technology. This means four things: hundreds of SSD qualification tests, over a thousand hours of prerelease validation testing, 1.5 billion dollars invested in R&D, and more than 30 years of industry expertise. With our multi-billion dollar commitment to NAND development, our record of patent and process innovation, and our award-winning customer support team, we’re dedicated to quality.  For you, that means your SSD has been designed with cutting-edge technology and it’s been rigorously tested and approved. Don’t settle for anything less.|*1 GB = 1 billion bytes.

If you're using this for a video camera, then the write speed is more important and the Samsung outperforms the Sandisk.As far as long term stability of the card, I've had a lot of off-brand cards and even after several years I've yet to have a failure, so I'd imagine the Samsung is every bit as good as the ""no-name"" cards.>>>Samsung EVO Class 10Sequential Read :  23.568 MB/sSequential Write :  16.343 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  23.056 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  21.477 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  6.702 MB/s [  1636.2 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.609 MB/s [  392.8 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  7.376 MB/s [  1800.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.389 MB/s [  339.2 IOPS]>>>Sandisk Ultra Class 10Sequential Read :  31.053 MB/sSequential Write :  13.109 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  27.086 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  0.574 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.217 MB/s [  785.5 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  1.390 MB/s [  339.3 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  3.073 MB/s [  750.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.419 MB/s [  346.5 IOPS]",4,Test results show this to be comparable to Sandisk class 10,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,summary performs very well compared to sandisk which tend to consider the gold standard for microsd card performance and stabilityi tested with bit crystaldiskmark and its very close in performance the samsung writes a little faster but reads a bit slower as a rough metric i combine the readwrite speeds since you usally need to do both to transfer data the samsung is while the sandisk is about faster overall if youre using this for a video camera then the write speed is more important and the samsung outperforms the sandiskas far as long term stability of the card ive had a lot of offbrand cards and even after several years ive yet to have a failure so id imagine the samsung is every bit as good as the noname cardssamsung evo class sequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopssandisk ultra class sequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iops,summary performs very well compared sandisk tend consider gold standard microsd card performance stabilityi tested bit crystaldiskmark very close performance samsung writes little faster reads bit slower rough metric combine readwrite speeds since usally need both transfer data samsung sandisk faster overall youre using video camera write speed more important samsung outperforms sandiskas far long term stability card ive lot offbrand cards even several years ive yet failure so id imagine samsung every bit good noname cardssamsung evo class sequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopssandisk ultra class sequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iops,22-Jul-14,1484,250,Electronics|Computers & Accessories|Computer Accessories & Peripherals|Memory Cards,Computers,"Save your precious memories - fast.

A2MQFJ7M9K1URL,B00CD1FB26,Leethellama,"[0, 0]",0.0,"Okay seriously these headphones are amazing. Now I do see people complaining that they lack bass. Now I did listen to them in store at Target, Best Buy, and Fry's Electronics and I have to agree with those people. BUT and this is a huge but!!!! I just bought a pair and they have WAY more bass than the store models and I have a theory. I think Bose did get complaints that they lacked bass and quietly fixed it. I say that because I used the in store demos and they have been there probably since launch and the ones I just received from Bose today though UPS have a lot more bass! (Mind you I tested the same songs at home and at the retail demo) They sound phenomenal, the demo sounded flat when it came to the bass. They now have a deep boom that isn't overbearing but is much louder than before!That being said these headphones are excellent! Pros and Cons.Pros:Sound: They sound phenomenal! Excellent bass, and crisp but not too bright highs with a perfect amount of mid for voice. Also for not having Noise Cancellation they block a lot of external sound.Build quality: Sturdy but light, they feel heavy enough to take a drop and very comfortable!Bluetooth Connection: Excellent, probably the best Bluetooth connection I have ever used. It's completely buzz, hiss, pop, and interference free! You can use two devices at the same time and it works well. I am using them on my Mac but I still get my iPhone notification sounds.Value: To be honest I don't think they're overpriced. I have looked at similar Bluetooth headphone and they pale in comparison to quality and sound that these Bose headphones have. I'm in love with them and I think $250 is a very fair price for these headphones.Battery Life: 7 hours seems to be enough to last a full day and if you're a power user then the included 3.5 headphone jack for wired use will be just fine! You can unplug the Bluetooth module and charge it while you still use the headphones with the included headphone cord for wired use.Cons:Included Accessories: The carrying case is just a cloth bag...

I was planing to get a 42in til I saw the deal on this puppy...couldn't pass it up! I have had this a few weeks now and ready to spring a review.-  I read an online review while I was scrutinizing it on the showroom floor. All the cons the author talked about like ghosting and and poor viewing angles seemed completely fabricated to me...maybe he cut and pasted from the 2008 model or something. This TV is very capable...it rocks!-  Unbelievable bargain for those Few that happen to use a PS3, Xbox, Roku, etc, etc to add ""smartness"" to their TV viewing. No apps on this one...no upcharge either.  No Problem at all watching Amazon Prime thru my PSx.- I actually prefer the VIVID setting (as they had it set in the store) for my viewing, even though my room is darlk...I like colors to pop! Vivid is good eXpecially for 3D content which seems to dim the picture down about 30-50%...I didn't expect that with active 3D glasses. I always heard that passive cuts the light in half, but apparently so does active 3D.- I am really impressed with the ability of the panel to deliver ""synthetic"" 3D from whatever you are watching. However, after an hour I tend to get a headache, so I use it sparingly. I'll update again after I watch an actual Hobbit 3D bluray this week. I did not notice any ghosting either. I like the 3D button on the remote which skips the menus.- I have to admit, the remote and the features on this TV could use some work. My Sharp Aquos has a ""view"" button that allows me to flip through a few screen fitting adjustments and I have never had a problem getting what I like out of it to easily fit on the screen. I find myself watching a lot of 720p content on this TV in a smaller boxed area, If you magnify it, then its too big to fit on the screen and you lose content. That just seems stupid to me...if Sharp can do it, why can't Samsung? I also like all the shortcut buttons on the Sharp remote, where with Samsung I feel I am spending waay too much time in the menus to get things done.-  The speakers are actually impressive for 8 watts, that being said...they should have been at least 15 watts. I have it on 45 volume if the aircon is on, any louder than that, it starts to get distortion. So they definitely skimped on the speakers a bit more than they should have. This TV is my travel partner, so no surround system is going to accompany me to hotels or temporary living sites. One thing I have considered, is using the headphone jack with a set of PC speakers...if I get that setup I will update the review about how that worked out.- I have not done much gaming on it yet, but so far it seems fine. I will update if I see any lag problems. I typically play mostly RPG's where that is rarely a big issue.-  All-in-all I have No deal-breaking complaints about the TV so I am giving it 4 stars. Based on price it could possibly be a quarter to half a point more than that. Too bad they don't have a 1 to 10 scale on amazon. It definitely helps sooth my Sharp Aquos withdrawal pangs when I am working away from home.",4,Great picture from any angle...fit-to-screen needs some work,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,first off

A2W73JAQ4AVCNJ,B00CA9I1P0,Jim Hart,"[0, 0]",0.0,"This review is for the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield, which I mounted on a Dell Venue 8 Pro.The package comes with the shield, a liquid used to ease the installation, a micro fiber cloth, a plastic/rubber squeegee used to remove air bubbles, and an instruction sheet.I followed the instructions and had no problems in fitting the shield to the tablet; the shield fits only one way so it is difficult to get it on the wrong way.  (One side has adhesive, the other does not).I had issues getting the air bubbles completely out - more from my being fumble fingered, I think, than anything faulty with the product or the installation.  I have applied smaller shields to other devices (such as view screens on cameras) but this shield is, of course, larger and so there are more opportunities for allowing air to be trapped.After a few days, however, nearly all of the air bubbles have dissipated by themselves and the few remaining have dwindled in size and are obviously on their way to escaping.The shield itself has a nice, cushiony feel to it and tapping the screen with a stylus results in diminished noise over the noise created tapping on a bare screen.I use the Dell stylus (version 2) and the shield does not interfere with using the stylus in any way.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G0UARLQ/ref=cfb_at_prodpgThe main reason I installed the shield was not for protection from the stylus, but rather from the keyboard.  I (frequently) use the tablet in a case that offers a Bluetooth keyboard and when the case is folded closed the keyboard comes in direct contact with the tablet.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JM17LNW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The ArmorSuit shield helps protect the screen from any rubs that the opening and closing of the case (and keyboard) might happen.Patience is recommended when installing the shield, and if you experience trapped air bubbles give it a day or three and see if they disappear on their own before attempting a reinstall of the shield.",5,Patience called for - but the results are worth the trouble!,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,this review is for the armorsuit militaryshield which i mounted on a dell venue prothe package comes with the shield a liquid used to ease the installation a micro fiber cloth a plasticrubber squeegee used to remove air bubbles and an instruction sheeti followed the instructions and had no problems in fitting the shield to the tablet the shield fits only one way so it is difficult to get it on the wrong way one side has adhesive the other does noti had issues getting the air bubbles completely out more from my being fumble fingered i think than anything faulty with the product or the installation i have applied smaller shields to other devices such as view screens on cameras but this shield is of course larger and so there are more opportunities for allowing air to be trappedafter a few days however nearly all of the air bubbles have dissipated by themselves and the few remaining have dwindled in size and are obviously on their way to escapingthe shield itself has a nice cushiony feel to it and tapping the screen with a stylus results in diminished noise over the noise created tapping on a bare screeni use the dell stylus version and the shield does not interfere with using the stylus in any way main reason i installed the shield was not for protection from the stylus but rather from the keyboard i frequently use the tablet in a case that offers a bluetooth keyboard and when the case is folded closed the keyboard comes in direct contact with the tablet armorsuit shield helps protect the screen from any rubs that the opening and closing of the case and keyboard might happenpatience is recommended when installing the shield and if you experience trapped air bubbles give it a day or three and see if they disappear on their own before attempting a reinstall of the shield,review armorsuit militaryshield mounted dell venue prothe package comes shield liquid used ease installation micro fiber cloth plasticrubber squeegee used remove air bubbles instruction sheeti followed instructions no problems fitting shield tablet shield fits only one way so difficult get wrong way one side adhesive other noti issues getting air bubbles completely more fumble fingered think than anything faulty product installation applied smaller shields other devices such view screens cameras shield course larger so there more opportunities allowing air trappedafter few days however nearly all air bubbles dissipated few remaining dwindled size obviously way escapingthe shield nice cushiony feel tapping screen stylus results diminished noise noise created tapping bare screeni use dell stylus version shield not interfere using stylus any way main reason installed shield not protection stylus rather keyboard frequently use tablet case offers bluetooth keyboard when case folded closed keyboard comes direct contact tablet armorsuit shield helps protect screen any rubs opening closing case keyboard might happenpatience recommended when installing shield experience trapped air bubbles give day three see disappear own attempting reinstall shield,22-Jul-14,2001,322,Uncategorized,Uncategorized,No description available,Untitled,Unknown Brand,,positive,0.5438,0.05694444444444444,0.2,positive

Not sure why.The instructions are printed in such tiny fonts that I needed a magnifying glass to read them - and then they still seemed hard to read.  The instructions (written in poor English) did not seem to be created for Windows 8.  That said, eventually the thing did sync.  But it did take many attempts where it would sync, disconnect, etc.Note - if you are on Windows 8 and it asks for a PIN or password upon connecting, just hit the Enter key.  If you hit NEXT, as it indicates in the instructions, it won't finish syncing.  You'll know you have victory when the bluetooth mouse display shows a horizontal bar, indicating progress connecting.Now that it is synced, it seems pretty dependable.

A29OW5Q8ILG5L9,B00HUNUOJW,Matt K.,"[1, 1]",1.0,"To start, I ordered from Zhengnans Shop and as far as I can tell they are genuine. Shipping was a bit slow as they are coming from China. Others have said they got theirs in about 8 days, but it took 15 days for mine to arrive. Not the end of the world, but something to keep in mind.Before reviewing the sound quality and making a comparison to some other headphones, I thought I would start by describing the packaging. These come in a small box with an outer cardboard box that unfolds and displays instructions on the inside (all in chinese, but with pictures to help). As others have said, there is a nice little pleasant smell of chocolate when you open the box. The headphones themselves are seated in a sturdy rubber insert that also functions as a cable winder and allows you to easily and securely store these headphones. My only concern there would be that the cables are going to get bent quite a bit here. But regardless, it seems like it would protect them quite well. Under the rubber insert are 3 extra pairs of tips, large, medium, and small, and a shirt clip.Again, still not touching the sound quality, one of the best features of these is the included remote/mic. I never much cared for them before, but this one is pretty great. There are 3 buttons. The two on the same side function as volume, and the third on the other allows you to play/pause your music (single click), go to the next track (double click) or activate google now/voice dialing by holding it down. As far as I know, most of these functions only work on android phones (and even then, not all) and not iphones. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and it seems to work fine. Advancing to the next track is a bit finicky and often pauses the songs instead of going to the next track. I have also had the button stop working once, but simply unplugging and plugging the headphones back in fixed that. Not sure if that is a flaw with the headphones or due to the fact that I am running a custom rom and not using the default music app.And now for sound quality. I should state that while I enjoy good sound, I do not quite have the... audio palette... of some of the more seasoned audiophiles. But I think I have a firm enough grasp, and I certainly know what I like and what sounds good. to me.I will also base this on my first impressions since I just received these yesterday. I also recently purchased and have been using two other pairs of IEMS, a similarly priced LG quadbeats HSS-F420B and a HifiMan RE-400.The LG Pair is decent, but I found them a bit uncomfortable my ears and the sound quality, while good, is just not quite as good as these pistons.The pistons themselves have a nice warm sound. The bass is quite present, and is actually a bit louder than I was expecting, and the mids and highs also present themselves nicely, but the bass here definitely seems to take over, but just by a little bit. Sound is very pleasant and there is quite a lot of detail. The soundstage is quite nice too and there is decent space between instruments and it does not sound at all claustrophobic.Compared with the RE-400's, I find the RE-400's a little bit more detailed, they have a bit cleaner bass, and the mids definitely shine more with the RE-400's. That being said, after listening to these, bass quantity does seem to be lacking on the 400's, but I think that is more a symptom of the 400's trying to be as neutral as possible. The sound of the 400's is ever so much more balanced and detailed, but the fact that these Pistons can compete with a pair four times as expensive is pretty great. Throw in the included remote and the value of these headphones cannot be beat.I switched to the large tips and was able to get a decent seal, but I found that I had to put the headphones in at the correct angle or they wouldn't seal at all, which was a bit odd. It also seemed like if I tried to push them farther in to get a better seal, the seal would actually come undone. The tips are very soft, which is both good and bad. As I said, because of that its hard to get a seal, but they are very comfortable so far and I could see wearing them for extended periods of time. I do not know how good of a fit they are, so I am not sure they would remain secure while out for a jog or anything.Isolation was ok, and there are definitely some microphonics present. If you are looking for a pair to really block out all outside noise, these are probably not for you.Overall, I think these are a really great pair of headphones. The sound is very good, especially at the price, and add in the included remote and the value is really unbeatable.In fact I thought they were such a good value I just ordered a second pair. These are coming prime from boat2014, which others have said is a legit source.

detail the soundstage is quite nice too and there is decent space between instruments and it does not sound at all claustrophobiccompared with the res i find the res a little bit more detailed they have a bit cleaner bass and the mids definitely shine more with the res that being said after listening to these bass quantity does seem to be lacking on the s but i think that is more a symptom of the s trying to be as neutral as possible the sound of the s is ever so much more balanced and detailed but the fact that these pistons can compete with a pair four times as expensive is pretty great throw in the included remote and the value of these headphones cannot be beati switched to the large tips and was able to get a decent seal but i found that i had to put the headphones in at the correct angle or they wouldnt seal at all which was a bit odd it also seemed like if i tried to push them farther in to get a better seal the seal would actually come undone the tips are very soft which is both good and bad as i said because of that its hard to get a seal but they are very comfortable so far and i could see wearing them for extended periods of time i do not know how good of a fit they are so i am not sure they would remain secure while out for a jog or anythingisolation was ok and there are definitely some microphonics present if you are looking for a pair to really block out all outside noise these are probably not for youoverall i think these are a really great pair of headphones the sound is very good especially at the price and add in the included remote and the

I want to add something on their customer service as well because I have had to call about three different tablet brands over time and the ASUS customer service was really helpful and nicer overall. I had an issue out of the box with regard to access and the representative sat on the phone for over an hour making certain that the issue was remedied and that I had no more questions. Kudos for that.This tablet is really light, which is something I like a lot, but it feels good while you hold it. Some of the models outside the ASUS line I have tried out in the past felt or looked cheap and that is annoying. I want a reasonable price, but I also want a tablet that looks and feels good and this fits the bill. It is also easy to use, with the newer menu changes making finding specific items a lot easier. This is something I try to keep in mind when picking up a tablet for family members who are trying to shake their Luddite status.As far as speed goes, I can definitely tell a difference with this model compared to previous ones. Loading items from the internet, running programs; it has made me a lot happier. My older tablets lagged or delayed but this one brings up items with a snap. The display looks nice, too, and can easily be seen in day use, and the speed kept up with 1080p streaming. I like reading on the go, especially comic books, and find that the newer tablets bring out a crispness that adds to that - although I will note that there is a lot of zooming if you use a 7' tablet. The specs are nice for the cost; 16 GB and a gig of Ram; add in the SD slot, a MUST in my book, for additional items or carrying specific files and that makes the tablet useful for all kinds of hobbies.A con for some is the camera, which is grainy anywhere you need a little light.

In January 2014, I broke down and bought a used Samsung Note 8.0 which I have been enjoying but has some drawbacks. It's the LG g 8.3 I wanted but too pricey for my wallet. The LG g 8.3 tablet has the right specs and build and I always loved their phones. When it was priced at $200 it was too good to pass up.  The aluminum backing and sharp screen make it a joy to use and hold. I bought the snow white one and purchased a 32 GB memory card to expand functionality.The Note’s plastic glossy backing is a fingerprint hog. Even with light use, it looks like I have been eating fried chicken while handling the unit. While the Note’s screen has good color, the LG is better resolution- I can see no pixels when I look at a picture or high res image. Response is good with all Apps except Kindle’s which lags in an odd way turning book pages. Battery life drops faster than the Note or Nexus. I haven’t worn the battery down to zero to test it yet but on Recharge, I found that disabling the wifi or shutting down helps speed things. The charger that come with the LG outputs 1.5 amps- more than the Nexus charger or others orphan chargers about the house.My only other comment is that the LG drops wifi signal. The Note or Nexus does not. It makes for a poor experience.

The Nikon 17-55mm f2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX is the world's first constant f2.8 3.2x zoom lens developed exclusively for use with Nikon DX Format. The 3.2x zoom covers from a wide angle of 79 degrees to a narrow angle of 28 degrees 50 minutes (equivalent to 25.5mm to 85.5mm for 35mm format) and is ideal for architecture, landscape, groups shots and portraits.|  Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.   The Nikon 17-55mm f2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX is the world's first constant f2.8 3.2x zoom lens developed exclusively for use with Nikon DX Format. The 3.2x zoom covers from a wide angle of 79 degrees to a narrow angle of 28 degrees 50 minutes (equivalent to 25.5mm to 85.5mm for 35mm format) and is ideal for architecture, landscape, groups shots and portraits. DX design enables a combination of wider angle-of-view with optical characteristics that are optimized for Nikon digital SLR camera sensors. Nikon DX design produces a smaller image circle (the size of the image that is projected by the lens on to the sensor) enabling smaller lens diameter, lighter weight, and optimal image quality from center-to edge-to-corner on the image.   Three Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) glass elements minimize chromatic aberration and provide higher resolution and superior contrast. Three aspherical lens elements minimize distortion in a lightweight and compact design similar to 17-35mm f2.8 lens. The exclusive Silent Wave Motor enables ultra-high-speed autofocusing with exceptional accuracy and powerful super-quiet operation. [M/A] and [M] modes allow rapid switching between AF and MF operation. Internal Focusing design for smoother focusing and great body balance. Nikon D-type design provides precise distance information for flash and ambient light exposure processes. The rounded diaphragm makes out-of-focus elements appear more natural. The G Type DX Nikkor is designed exclusively for use with Nikon Digital SLR models.  ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lenses Nikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.|Aspherical lens elements Nikon introduced the first photographic lens with aspherical lens elements in 1968. What sets them apart? Aspherical lenses virtually eliminate the problem of coma and other types of lens aberration--even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting the distortion in wide-angle lenses. In addition, use of aspherical lenses contributes to a lighter and smaller lens design. Nikon employs three types of aspherical lens elements. Precision-ground aspherical lens elements are the finest expression of lens-crafting art, demanding extremely rigorous production standards. Hybrid lenses are made of a special plastic molded onto optical glass. Molded glass aspherical lenses are manufactured by molding a unique type of optical glass using a special metal die technique.|Internal Focusing Imagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses.|Distance information D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.

AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's SWM which converts ""traveling waves"" into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.|M/A mode AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag--even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use.",Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 17-55mm f/2.8G IF-ED Zoom Lens with Auto Focus for Nikon DSLR Cameras,Nikon,69.35,positive,-0.2975,0.2,0.6,neutral

-Performance: The Pack reduces recycling time to less than half of a normal cycle and can give up to double the amount of flashes as the original (a). It is suitable for continuous flash use (b).

-Convenience: The Pack uses 8 AA batteries (same batteries as flash) and with different connecting plugs, supports most Canon flashes to greatly increase flash capacity. 

Operating method: 1. When you put the 8 AA batteries into it, you can see the red light blink once, but only once, you can not see constant red light.

2. The flash will not work if there are no batteries in the Flash Unit. This battery pack only acts a part of charging power to the Capacitors inside the Flash Unit, it would not work with the other units inside the flash.

3. The red light may blink once after the firing of your flash, that indicates that the battery pack is charging power to the Capacitors.

4. You may not get consistent firing if you put your flash to Max power output. 

5. The pack getting hot is normal because the AA batteries will get hot after continuous firing.

6. There is no indication or warning signal on the battery pack. To tell the battery volume, please pay attention to the Recycling Time. If the Recycling Time becomes longer, then the battery is running low.

7.You should put on the battery of the flash when useing the battery together.

I bought 2, one for home and one for my desk at work since I carry my devices back and forth.Prior to this I had an extension cord with a bunch of bulky charges plugged in. You can't plug 3 wall warts into the wall, unless you have them different locations or use some kind of power strip or extension cord, which becomes unsightly. So I hid them under the desk but then had to have 3 - 6 foot USB cables running around the edge one for each device, making more cables to get tangled up. With the Anker you can put it desktop and just run the one cord to the wall or ups battery backup.At work I placed the Anker under my monitor and only see the 5 ports, easy to reach if I need to add or change a cable. it sits nicely on the desktop being it is box shape. Then using shorter USB cables to each device it is a much cleaner look and less tangle. Plus I have a couple of extra ports for future devices.At home I have a small table for my iPads and this fits nicely hanging under the bottom shelf of the table so USB power is in an easy to reach spot for my devices and there is only one cord running across the floor.I also like it has no lights so it doesn't keep me awake at night.

The tablet charges about 25% faster and is far easier to use than a having to plug in a microUSB cable. A USB cable coming out of the dock plugs into the wall adapter that comes with the tablet - so it works in any country.   Easy Docking and Undocking -Since the connector is magnet based, there is nothing to plug in - magnets auto align the tablet to the charging pins and the tablet snaps into place. You can do it in complete darkness! This is as close to wireless charging as you're going to get with this tablet - just pick it up when you need it. Tip: instead of pulling the tablet up to disengage the connection, just pull the tablet towards you from the top and it will easily snap out without moving the dock.   Weighted  - Added steel weights inside the dock provide for increased stability and security while the tablet is docked. Also makes undocking the tablet easier by keeping the dock still. However, for best results, undocking the tablet by pulling horizontally as described in the tip above is still recommended.

This is one of the simplest and most professional looking cases for your iPad Mini. The deep dark brown gives an elegant look and feel while the simplicity of this case is unrivaled. There's nothing super-fancy about it - it's just a basic synthetic leather sleeve with a premium look and feel. The synthetic leather has just enough cushion to protect your iPad but still remains a super thin solution for protecting your device while you throw it into your briefcase, backpack, or in with your stack of books.|How it works: The iPad is held into the case simply by friction - so no need to worry about breaking any buckles, snaps, or clasps.|Who should buy this? If you enjoy using your iPad without a case but still want to protect it when not in use - or find you remove your iPad from it's case often, this is the case for you (for example, if you remove it from its case often to mount into our Koala Tablet Wall Mount). If you are looking for a complicated product that does all sorts of fancy stands and flips, don't buy this. If you want a simple, beautiful sleeve for your iPad, this is the case for you. It's elegant and professional, yet incredibly easy to get your iPad in and out, frustration free.|Compatibility: This sleeve is designed to be compatible with the original iPad Mini, the iPad Mini Retina, the iPad Mini 2, and the iPad Mini 3 but also fits the Acer Iconia A1-830 and the Yarvik Noble Mini 7.85 very well. It may also work with similarly sized Android or Windows tablets like the HP 8, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (& LTE),and the Xiaomi Mipad. Please note that this sleeve is designed solely for use with a naked iPad for all versions of the Mini and is NOT compatible with the Smart Cover or any other cases. The sleeve is 215 mm x 155 mm. The iPad Mini is approximately 200 mm x 134 mm x 7.2 mm, so any tablet smaller than that should fit okay.","Dockem Slim Professional Sleeve for iPad Mini 4, 3, 2, 1; Premium Dark Brown Synthetic Leather; Slim, Simple, Executive Slip-on Tablet Case - Soft Felt Lined, Basic Protective Pouch Cover",Dockem,9.99,neutral,0.934,0.12333333333333334,0.0,positive
AXMPNTJU89DYS,B00KONCDVM,"The Electroacoustic Metallurgist ""Bill""","[0, 0]",0.0,"I've been using these Bluetooth earbuds nearly every day for a month now, and I like them a lot. And while a month certainly isn't a great deal of time, so far they have worked well, and without issue.They come with three sets of different size rubber tips/pads, and two sets of different size ""fins"" to custom fit them to your ears. I chose to use the middle size rubber tips, and the large fins. For me, this arrangement held them in my ears very securely, even when doing quite a bit of physical activity. I also found them to be quite comfortable, even when I've had them in for three or four hours.Outdoor Tech claims the Bluetooth range is thirty-two feet, and that number is actually pretty accurate. However, they also claim the battery play/talk time is six hours, and I found that number to be a bit exaggerated. I'm getting much closer to five hours of use on a full charge.I haven't owned a lot of Bluetooth earbuds, but I have listened to quite a few pairs, and of the ones I've listened to and owned, these do sound the best. They sound terrific. Very nice highs, nice midrange, and good bass. They don't sound anywhere near as good as my over-ear Sennheiser HD 650s, and I didn't expect them to, but for on-the-go earbuds, they do sound excellent.As you likely know, these Bluetooth earbuds have a built-in in-line microphone, which gives you the ability to use them for phone calls. However, in my opinion, you should consider that nothing more than a nice bonus feature. The overall quality of that feature is lacking when compared to a traditional Bluetooth headset, and you should use a traditional Bluetooth headset if you're wanting something primarily for phone calls.These Bluetooth earbuds currently cost $100, and at that price I think they're definitely worth considering. There are certainly cheaper Bluetooth earbuds out there, but these earbuds sound terrific, work well, and so far they seem to be handling moisture/sweat much better than any other Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Consequently, I do recommend these earbuds. Give them a try. I'm confident you'll be happy with them.If you have any questions about these earbuds, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my very best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.",4,Very Nice Bluetooth Earbuds,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,ive been using these bluetooth earbuds nearly every day for a month now and i like them a lot and while a month certainly isnt a great deal of time so far they have worked well and without issuethey come with three sets of different size rubber tipspads and two sets of different size fins to custom fit them to your ears i chose to use the middle size rubber tips and the large fins for me this arrangement held them in my ears very securely even when doing quite a bit of physical activity i also found them to be quite comfortable even when ive had them in for three or four hoursoutdoor tech claims the bluetooth range is thirtytwo feet and that number is actually pretty accurate however they also claim the battery playtalk time is six hours and i found that number to be a bit exaggerated im getting much closer to five hours of use on a full chargei havent owned a lot of bluetooth earbuds but i have listened to quite a few pairs and of the ones ive listened to and owned these do sound the best they sound terrific very nice highs nice midrange and good bass they dont sound anywhere near as good as my overear sennheiser hd s and i didnt expect them to but for onthego earbuds they do sound excellentas you likely know these bluetooth earbuds have a builtin inline microphone which gives you the ability to use them for phone calls however in my opinion you should consider that nothing more than a nice bonus feature the overall quality of that feature is lacking when compared to a traditional bluetooth headset and you should use a traditional bluetooth headset if youre wanting something primarily for phone callsthese bluetooth earbuds currently cost and at that price i think theyre definitely worth considering there are certainly cheaper bluetooth earbuds out there but these earbuds sound terrific work well and so far they seem to be handling moisturesweat much better than any other bluetooth earbuds ive owned consequently i do recommend these earbuds give them a try im confident youll be happy with themif you have any questions about these earbuds please feel free to ask and ill do my very best to answer i hope you found this review helpful,ive using bluetooth earbuds nearly every day month now like lot month certainly isnt great deal time so far worked well without issuethey come three sets different size rubber tipspads two sets different size fins custom fit ears chose use middle size rubber tips large fins arrangement held ears very securely even when quite bit physical activity also found quite comfortable even when ive three four hoursoutdoor tech claims bluetooth range thirtytwo feet number actually pretty accurate however also claim battery playtalk time six hours found number bit exaggerated im getting much closer five hours use full chargei havent owned lot bluetooth earbuds listened quite few pairs ones ive listened owned sound best sound terrific very nice highs nice midrange good bass dont sound anywhere near good overear sennheiser hd s didnt expect onthego earbuds sound excellentas likely know bluetooth earbuds builtin inline microphone gives ability use phone calls however opinion should consider nothing more than nice bonus feature overall quality feature lacking when compared traditional bluetooth headset should use traditional bluetooth headset youre wanting something primarily phone callsthese bluetooth earbuds currently cost price think theyre definitely worth considering there certainly cheaper bluetooth earbuds there earbuds sound terrific work well so far seem handling moisturesweat much better than any other bluetooth earbuds ive owned consequently recommend earbuds give try im confident youll happy themif any questions earbuds please feel free ask ill very best answer hope found review helpful,22-Jul-14,2255,391,Electronics|Headphones|Earbud Headphones,Home Audio & Theater,"The Orcas are Outdoor Tech's latest sweat-proof, and water resistant active wireless ear buds.

The first thing I noticed, however, was how hard it was to see the little blue light that indicated the headphones are 'on'. It's a very teeny little light on the underside of one of the earbuds. It's almost easier to just pop in the headphones, turn them on and wait for the audible beep.I forgot to put in the ""fins"", so that probably explains why every time I touched them to adjust the volume, they felt like they were going to fall out. So, yeah. Put the ""fins"" on/in. And make sure you select the right size of rubber tips.The sound is good: people can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine. The only time I had someone complain about the sound quality was when I was calling from my car on the interstate. I think the ambient road noise was a bit much and caused the other person to struggle to hear me. Listening to music was a much better experience - no issues there. Sound is good and the noise cancelling works quite well.I found that taking/making a call with both earbuds in was very... uncomfortable. Since they are noise-cancelling headphones, it's odd to hear your voice when both of your ears are plugged. So, when I was on calls, I would just put one earbud in and leave the other one dangling.I love that these are relatively ""cordless"" - meaning, they're not attached to your phone. I chose to wrap them around the back of my head and didn't have any difficulty adjusting the sound. The volume up/down and ""call"" button are pretty close together on the cord, so you'll have to feel for them, but the middle ""call"" button is more raised, so you should be able to make adjustments without struggling too much.Overall, I really like them and they've proved to be a valuable device to have when roaming around the house and yard and making calls.

This range can be effectively doubled through the use of Intelligent Digital Zoom, and a lens-shift image stabilization system benefits shooting at such magnifications by reducing the appearance of camera shake.

A4Y4XAD69HESP,B00B3QD94O,fumobs,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I love these headphones.  I don't own a ton of mid or high-end HP's like others, but I've had a chance to ""demo"" a few good and even great ones (Grado SR225, 325, PS500, and Audeze LCD3 were the last pairs I tried on).  I'm not a headphone connoisseur, so I unfortunately won't be able to describe the X1's like some lavish, decadent food that makes your mouth gush with drool.  With that forewarning said, I'll begin my personal review.There are people who have a very select set of musical genre they listen to...all bass-y types, or all acoustic/classical, or hip-hop/edm/techno.  The point is: their taste isn't all over the place.  For those people, their preferred headphones are well-suited to a specific set of genre.  Well, that unfortunately isn't me.  While I largely listen to rock/indie/acoustic genres and live soundtracks (let's say 70%), I like to be prepared for when I deviate from the norm (hip-hop, country, classical and some EDM/techno/rave).  I can't afford another set of headphones right now, so my only choice is an all-rounder.  I also love to pick apart and analyze songs, but I also want to have a fun listening experience.  This is how the X1 has won my heart.  I know that the X1's are not for analytical listening...but i'll do that with any pair of headphones that are capable of giving me even a decent bit of clarity.There is a sound signature that I appreciate about headphones like the Grado's, but they don't seem to have enough life on the low-end to be exciting.  Enter the X1!  On certain live tracks where synthesized boominess, drums, bass guitar, cello or similar is the signature kick for the song, the X1's have certainly exceeded my expectations and made me smile.  The right word to describe my experience: EXCITING.  There is just enough that they don't invade or drown out the vocals and acoustic/electric guitars.Regarding vocal listening: the X1's were great, sometimes I was even amazed.  They perform well...but I felt they were a bit recessed at times.  On certain tracks where I just want to hear detail and clarity, the X1's could only do so much justice.  At this point, I don't know if a headphone exists that is like the X1 but where the vocals are not compromised at all.  I think that, in this department and price point, a great headphone may have been the ATH-AD900X...but the low-end took a backseat with that headphone which is one of the reasons I never kept it.  The words to describe my experience: there are many times where the vocals are wonderful and quite enjoyable, but other times they take a bit of a backseat to everything else when I don't want them to.Regardings the electric and acoustic guitars: they're amazing.  For me, there is a great bit of clarity when I hear a guy shredding away on his electric while another guy is complimenting with picking.  Or sometimes I'll listen to a classical piece and I want to zone in on the violins...AMAZING.  The best part is that I don't get that ear-piercing feeling, whereas a headphone like the ATH-AD900X sometimes did.Another reviewer had described the X1 as a ""jack of all trades, master of none"".  I think this is quite a befitting description.  Perhaps even in some sense (maybe just mine), the X1 is in a class of its own.  How many open-backed headphones have performed as well as this?I encourage anyone interested on the X1 to do their due diligence before purchasing.  But I think there is a high chance you won't regret it, especially if you're new to headphones and want a fun listening experience.  With the X1, you won't have a headphone that's unique and one of the best at one thing, but at least you're not going to lose out on much with the way it performs very well as an all-rounder.  I also bought it around three months ago when it was around $200--quite a sweet deal considering it's around $260 as of this review.  I can't say I would've purchased the X1 if it was $260 simply because around that price point I would've been looking at more headphones and could have easily taken a chance on another set.",5,I love

AHFGCH8LANEZK,B00J4O573S,Dana G.,"[0, 0]",0.0,"My kids are past the age of having to be entertained by cartoons in the car, thankfully.  I have tried this in my car a few times myself.  My car headrests are very hard to raise up, which I keep them in the lowest position because I am short and can't see if they are up, plus nobody really tall sits in my front seats anyway.  Once I finally get the headrest raised, then this case is really kind of hard to hook onto them.  Getting the hooks off is no problem, but I feel like I might snap the elastic when I'm trying to put them on.  Once the hooks are on, this thing is pretty cool.  It does not budge because it is very snug.  You can move it up and down on the headrest prongs (for lack of a better term) and it will be solid.As far as the case goes, I really love it.  Even though I hardly ever use the case as a ""car cartoon viewer"" the case is awesome in itself.  I love the more rubbery feel of the case that the iPad snaps into more than the hard plastic feel of my other cases.  Also when I watch my baseball games on my iPad on my couch, I can pop out the hooks and improve viewing angle if the cover being propped up isn't high enough.

A1D1IDI5S9TN9D,B00IMUAYRY,Rich,"[0, 0]",0.0,"Like a lot of PC gamers from the 90's, I fondly remember my old Alienware tower with its glowing green lights and never-ending stream of hardware upgrades.  It was a hard fall for Alienware that took it from the pinnacle of PC performance to the auction table at Dell (really?  Dell?  Like, ""Dude, you're getting a Dell""?).  Through much of the Windows Vista and 7 generations, Alienware has been the joke of the PC gaming world.  But having played around with this bad-boy, my first Alienware in 15 years, I'm starting to see where Dell is going.First off, let's shed the notion that this is a gaming laptop.  It isn't.  There is no numpad and the keys aren't really set up right for a hardcore PC gaming.  Don't get me wrong, with a dedicated 2GB GeForce GTX graphics card it will game and game well, but it's not a true gaming machine (unless you're docking it to a second monitor andkeyboard).  It is, however, a true desktop replacement that embraces its ""chunky-base design with uncompromised capability"" over the ""sleeker aesthetic with less power"" of other laptops.  The fact that it still embraces Windows 7 over Windows 8 also makes it a bit more useful, at least until Win8.2 lands.What I love is the snappy speed.  My Sony and HP are also i5 machines with comparable RAM, but the Alienware just moves faster, especially when handling resource-intense programs likeCS6,Project, andAccess.  Pair that with a casing that exudes build quality, from the premium feel of the clamshell hinges to the wabble-free movement of the keys, and Dell is showing that they're serious about making Alienware a premier machine again after years of abusing the marque.  Equally impressive, that I didn't expect from Dell, is the volume and clarity of the soundbar, something that is not vaunted in the listing and should be.  Easily exceeding both my Vaio and HP, the sound system on the Alienware is impressive in its own right, which is good since it's built to be a multimedia machine.Dell's decision to keep an optical drive cost space and weight, leading to the heavier build than other increasingly-popular ultrabooks.  But the 2500 knows what is and embraces its less-than-sexy design with grace.  That extra space is put to good use, with a near-silent cooling system that keeps this power hog from ever getting warm to the touch, while also tucking extras like custom LED backlights under the keyboard and around accent panels.  The crystal-clear webcam in my Sony was one of its key selling points, and Dell has created an impressive rival.  And while it lacks some of the first-party software that Sony, HP, and Samsung pack into their PC's, there is ample support to do what you want, if not all the bells and whistles (or bloatware, depending on your point-of-view).Everything prior to this point in the review has been based on the stock Alienware 14 2500.  I expect that's how most people will buy and use it.  Out of the box, the Alienware 14 clocks in a Windows Experience Index of 5.9, close to my 2-year-oldSony Vaio.  That belies its true capability, because when I dug deeper I found only the choice of using a disc hard drive held it back from a much-higher rating.  In fact, the next-lowest score (calcs-per-second) comes in at an astonishing 7.2.  Pretty good for an 2.5GHz i5 processor and 8GB of memory (see customer photos for a screenshot with the details).  So I did a little surgery,doubled the memoryand swapped to a256GB SSD, and now I'm clocked at a 7.3 Index rating.  That's a major jump and an unbelievably fast laptop for an extra couple hundred bucks, about half what it would cost to jump to thenext Alienware model.  I don't have much affinity for the i7 in laptops, since my experience is that they thrust and lag instead of the more consistent performance the i5 delivers, so that 7.3 is about the best I'll be able to squeeze out of this baby.  For just over a grand, that's pretty impressive.",4,Solid higher-end laptop,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",7/22/2014,like a lot of pc gamers from the s i fondly remember my old alienware tower with its

A2JUO2M5VA8EGU,B00IKF2H12,Street,"[1, 1]",1.0,"I did a ton of research and considered several other laptops around and above the price of this one. I considered the Alienware, MSI, Origin, and Toshiba laptops. After reading reviews and looking at all the specs, I could not be happier with this machine.Pros:-More than enough power for any productivity software-Excellent for gaming (High settings)-Multitasks well-Keyboard feels nice, isn't laid out weird, and the lighting is a nice touch-A good value (considering the hardware)-1080P display is very nice. A few reviewers have complained of dim screens but I have no issues at all. The colors are nice and I find the display itself nice even in full lighting.-Speakers and built in subwoofer are good (not great) for a laptop-Quiet-Thick heat sinks and dual fans keep this thing nice and cool while it's on.-Best touchpad I've used on a laptop. Accurate, doens't jump around, and the left/right click buttons are easy to use.-Wireless card on board is super super fast. I'm getting 95% of what I would get on a wired connection.Cons:-This thing is very large and very heavy. I knew this going in, but if I were taking this to school everyday I may reconsider modelsIf you're looking at this model as a desktop replacement, the size is more of a pro.-Bags for this laptop are difficult to find due to the size.-Windows 8, it's clunky and I feel like alot of programs don't work properly-Asus installed their own software, which I feel is unnecessary and usually more annoying than anything.-Power brick is massiveOther thoughts:I had to RMA my first one. I was getting artifacts while gaming that persisted through the latest driver updates and driver reinstalls. After I started to get daily BSOD (which look weird in Windows 8.1), I started the RMA process. For anyone who has not used Amazon for an RMA, there's no one doing it better than them. They sent me a new laptop that was at my doorstep in two days. I had 30 days to send the old one back, which gave me time to wipe the drives and such. Thanks Amazon.The second laptop has had none of the issues the first had. It isn't worth deducting a star in my opinion.I ordered a SSD for this machine, but have not had the chance to install it. I can only imagine how fast this thing would be upgrading from the 5400 rpm drive.I ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWN8YA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_21 to carry this machine around in.

A3RR7N0Y5OPRNF,B00ID2HJFQ,Z. Duncan,"[0, 0]",0.0,"7/23/2014I must say this is the best TV I have ever seen. I wish I could afford the 78"" one though. I settled on the 65"" version for the price. $4500 vs $8K  was a big selling point for me. I'm waiting on my free USB hard drive to really see what this TV can do. 4K looks amazing and even upscaling adds to your viewing experience. The curve doesn't bother me but my wife hates it. I wish Samsung would have just given us this TV in a non curved form. But they want to sell their 9 series, and if they would have offered a flat version I believe that's the one everyone including myself would have purchased. I originally ordered the HU8550 but returned it because I would have had to purchase  a one connect box, and the 4K content USB Hard drive for an additional $700 bucks. So the $1200 price difference in models didn't seem that much more, when your getting a better TV w/ Clear Motion Rate 1440 vs 1200, a faster better Quadcore possessor, and a $100 camera built in ( that most likely won't get used outside of testing it out) included.  That being said, I am one of those early adopters that must always have the new shiny tech toy out on the market. I bought a 1st Gen 42"" HDTV 720p, as well as a 1st Gen 55"" 3D TV for almost the same price as this TV, and was stuck kicking myself when the next years model came out better and cheaper. This is my 6th HD TV (4th Samsung) and by far my best Samsung TV purchase and would recommend it if you can afford it. I just wish my wife would have let me go bigger, because I can't see much of a difference in the size  from my 55"".  But she did let me buy myself a 2014 GL450 and a new home this year so I won't complain to her anyways. So for anyone looking to upgrade to 4K this is the TV for you, or if you can hold off for 3rd Gen UHD TV to arrive next year do so. I got mine for about $2300 off so I had to jump on this TV but I would have most likely waited till next year to buy one when there would be more content and a real 4K Bluray player on the market.

A new, enhanced battery offers 2.5-times the record time of previous models for extended shooting time.|The VIXIA mini X is equipped with a genuine Canon f/2.8 fisheye lens to give your videos a look that conventional camcorders and cameras can't match. The ultra wide-angle lens provides a 150° angle of view during AVCHD recording, a 160° angle of view for MP4 video and 170° angle of view for still images, allowing the camcorder to capture scenes with your subject and everything around them. The wide shots have the outer edge perspective typical of a fisheye lens, shooting at a focal length of 17.5mm when recording AVCHD, 16.8mm for MP4 videos and 15.4mm for photos (35mm equivalent). And a centered 1920 x 1080 image is also available to record videos (1920 x 1440 for stills) with a more classic look with Close-up mode, which shoots at 35.0mm for videos and 32.1mm for photos (35mm equivalent).|The VIXIA mini X incorporates the latest and most advanced Canon HD Image Processor, the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor. A significant upgrade on several fronts, the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor features dramatically increased processing power and captures more light, for brighter, noise-free images even in dark scenes.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder features the Canon HS SYSTEM – a powerful combination of the Canon DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor and a 12.8 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor – that offers dramatically increased processing power and the ability to operate in lower light levels. By capturing more light, the camera produces brighter, noise-free images even during dark scenes, extending your ability to create images with spectacular depth and detail. The Canon HS SYSTEM also provides excellent tracking performance even with low light levels, to achieve outstanding still-image quality with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlights and shadow areas. An Auto Dynamic Range control and new gamma curve settings prevent over- and under-exposure, even when capturing high-contrast images. The end result is clearer HD videos and still images with reduced noise and motion blur in a variety of shooting situations.|The versatile VIXIA mini X camcorder offers a choice of two Full HD video recording formats to convenient SD-format memory cards. AVCHD secures enhanced images at 1920x1080 resolution and 60i frame rate, while MP4 format is available in either 1920x1080 or 1280x720 resolutions at 30p or 24p frame rates; MP4 640x360 is also possible at 4 Mbps for live-streaming applications. Time code data is provided on AVCHD recordings for compatibility for non-linear editing systems. MP4-format media is also conveniently available via internal transcoding of high-resolution AVCHD recordings, for quick and easy uploads to blogs and social networking websites.|The VIXIA mini X records digital video files on readily-available SD, SDHC or SDXC media for high-capacity storage and ultra-fast data transfer speeds to external editors and streaming services. The camcorder also captures high-quality images with up to 12.0 Megapixels of resolution.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder not only captures great video, but outstanding audio quality as well, thanks to its built-in, high-quality stereo microphone. The use of 16-bit Linear PCM audio* format at a CD-quality sampling rate of 48 kHz – rather than an MPEG or similar compression scheme that can diminish sonic quality – adds an extra dimension to any video recording, by capturing full-fidelity, pristine sound with depth and realistic nuances.|* Only supported in AVCHD/24 Mbps recording mode|Pristine audio recordings from a camcorder require a precision, low-noise microphone. The VIXIA mini X camcorder's high-quality, large-diameter stereo microphone captures enhanced, immersive sound that adds a heightened sense of stereo depth that further draws viewers into a video scene. A separate audio-level control ensures distortion-free recordings with no overload. The large 10mm microphone element is 2.5-times larger than the VIXIA mini with improved sensitivity. A higher signal-to-noise performance results in ultra-low noise recordings, while a two-layer sponge and cloth mesh windshield further reduces unwanted air-borne noise. The combination results in clearer, transparent recordings from low to high frequencies with low electrical noise.|Audio Scene Select on the VIXIA mini X lets you select optimized recording parameters for specific types of shoots, including newly added Meeting, Festival and Custom Setting modes. Meeting is the best choice for group recordings with multiple participants around the camcorder for a greater sense of ambiance. Festival is best for outdoor musical events to capture the sound of performers around the camera with a good stereo balance, while Custom settings offers individual adjustments of Directivity, Frequency Characteristics, Microphone Level, Wind Screen, Mic Attenuator, Audio Limiter and Audio Compressor.|Other modes comprise: Standard, which is best for weddings and similar events, with versatile, well-balanced settings for many occasions; Music for indoor performances to capture audio around the camera with emphasized contrast; Forest and Birds for natural environments to produce clear, expansive recordings of birdsong and other on-location shoots; Speech, to capture a specific individual, with recording focused in a single direction; and Noise Suppression, which has been optimized for in-vehicle recording to reduce road or wind noise.|A choice of Wide and Close-up shooting modes provides additional versatility. Wide mode records video with an expansive 150-degree angle of view for AVCHD and 160 degrees for MP4, capturing the whole scene. Additionally, the VIXIA mini X camcorder offers a useful Close-up Mode that uses the center of the video image where there is less peripheral distortion. Thanks to the camera's high-resolution sensor, even for close-up shots you are assured Full HD recording without image interpolation. An advanced electronic image stabilization system (EIS) helps ensure that images remain crisp during close-ups, even while the hand-held camera is moving. The EIS function is particularly useful for ENG-style interviews, dashboard-mount shoots and other productions where the camcorder is either handheld, or undergoes sideways or up-and-down motion.|During AVCHD-format recordings, Close-up mode offers an approximately 51-degree angle of view, while MP4-format videos offer an approximately 64-degree view; the narrower focus for AVCHD results from slight differences in image resolution. Still images offer an approximately 78-degree view in Close-up mode.|For integration within professional-level shoots, both time code and digital-format video output are necessary. The VIXIA mini X camcorder provides embedded time code for AVCHD-format recordings, which enables frame-accurate editing on professional NLE systems as well as the accurate synchronization of recordings from the VIXIA mini X with other video and audio recorders. User-selectable time code formats include NTSC 60i/30P or NTSC 24P, in either continuous Rec Run or Non Drop Frame configurations. In contrast, MP4 recording includes elapsed times of scenes in hours, minutes and seconds, plus remaining time.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's uncompressed HDMI output delivers a digital video signal with embedded two-channel audio in most camcorder and playback modes for live monitoring during shoots on a high-resolution 1080 monitor or large-screen TV. In this way you can check how shots with multiple participants – including band recordings – are being composed, or how a particular scene looks when shooting a wedding or conference event.|In addition to using the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in stereo microphone, external microphones can be connected to the camcorder for extra creative options or enhanced fidelity. A separate Mic Level control adjusts recording levels; you can also listen to recordings as they are being made using external headphones. For enhanced flexibility, other recording settings are available within Custom Audio Scene settings, including Wind Screen, Directionality, Attenuator and Frequency Characteristics (for the built-in mic), Low Cut, plus an Audio Limiter and Audio Compressor, which are particularly useful while recording live performances to even out dramatic differences in loudness. Mixed recording is also possible using an external microphone in conjunction with the camcorder's built-in mic.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in Wi-Fi® allows you to easily share MP4 video recordings and still images over the Internet via social networking sites such as YouTube™ and Facebook® using the CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# online photo storage service, or conveniently transfer your files to a home or office PC. Uploads can be made virtually anywhere using a familiar iOS® device and the free Canon Movie Uploader app*. HD video can also be shared with colleagues and co-workers whenever and wherever you need. The VIXIA mini X can be connected via Wi-Fi® using compatible home or office wireless networks, wireless hotspots and iOS-compatible mobile phones and tablets using the Movie Uploader app.|# One-time registration is required on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY online photo album. * This software enables you to upload images to social network sites. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software. Compatible with iOS version 5/6/7 or later for select devices. AVCHD recordings are not supported for this function.|The Live Streaming function enabled by the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in Wi-Fi® allows you to receive the live video and sound that your camcorder is recording from a remote location on your iOS® or Android™ device using the free Canon CameraAccess plus app†. The Canon CameraAccess plus app supports live streaming of video and remote control of key camcorder parameters, including record start/stop and zoom, from a compatible smart device; it can also integrate key system information such as battery life. The app can monitor live video from a smartphone or tablet, and also confirm that videos have been successfully recorded on a remotely located camcorder. In this way, you can review video files at home, or share media with colleagues working on a cooperative project in another remote location via peer-to-peer connections.|For remote surveillance applications, the camcorder can also be installed on an optional Canon Camera Pan Table CT-V1 that enables manual vertical tilt and horizontal panning across a 200-degree angle. Horizontal panning can be controlled via Wi-Fi® using a smartphone or tablet† with the CameraAccess plus app. Used with the VIXIA mini X camcorder's ultra wide-angle lens mode, which offers a wide angle of view, such a combination provides a nearly complete circular view.|† Compatible with iOS version 5/6/7 or later or Android version 2.3/4.0/4.1/4.2 or later for select devices. Operations not guaranteed with all versions of the supported OS.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's 2.7-inch LCD monitor lets you see every nuance of a scene, and quickly switch between video and still-image mode with fast, easy-to-use intuitive controls. A familiar touch panel lets you simply tap and swipe the screen in the same way as you might use a tablet or smartphone. The big LCD makes it easy to switch from shooting video to capturing still images from various angles – low, high and even inverted – with fast toggling between Wide and Close-up modes at the tap of a finger. You can easily scroll through captured images, tap through simple menu options, and then quickly share projects with friends and colleagues, with a fast and intuitive user interface designed to accommodate the needs of contemporary video and photo shoots.|A built-in, adjustable stand and tripod socket enable easy positioning of the VIXIA mini X camcorder, making it possible to shoot scenes hands-free, including presentations in which you are starring. The combination of a large, variable-angle LCD screen that flips on parallel hinges, and a built-in stand that adjusts to various positions, offer virtually limitless shooting options. You can shoot low-angle with the screen fully closed, and high-angle or straight on with the screen in the rear position. You can also shoot in multiple directions with the camera inverted; the camera automatically rotates the image for playback. Hands-free videos have never been easier. Simply place the screen in the front position and position the sturdy stand at the required angle. A tripod socket helps ensure steady recordings.|The VIXIA mini X makes it easy to add interest and excitement to your MP4 video recordings using classic special effects. You can now control the pace and rhythm of office presentations, for example, with a choice of Slow Motion and Fast Motion sequences. Slow Motion is available at ½- and ¼-times play speed, for highlighting a manufacturing process, reviewing a complex maneuver or simply adding dramatic effects. Fast Motion at 2x and 4x play speeds is perfect for showing off creative talents in makeup, painting, woodworking and more, or accelerating various timelines.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's Interval Recording mode lets you see slow-changing movements over time. The camcorder records JPEG still images or half-second MP4 video clips at pre-determined intervals – 5, 10 or 30 seconds; 1 or 10 minutes – with playback in flip-book style. Perfect for recording plant growth, cloud movement, tidal changes, light effects from dawn to sunset and much more, this mode is also useful for adding a multimedia element to an office presentation or research project.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's newly designed NB-12L battery provides 2.5-times the capacity as previous models, for extended record times and additional still images from a single charge. You can now accommodate continuous video recordings of long meetings or music performances up to 150 minutes long. A convenient rear-panel layout and battery cover lets you swap with internal-charging batteries without removing the camcorder from its tripod.|A new Special Scene Mode, In The Car, brings to the VIXIA mini X an optimized exposure setting for a certain type of difficult-to-get-right video shoot. In The Car mode corrects exposure settings for passengers inside vehicles that tend to be backlit and, as a result, normally are shot too brightly; instead, the camcorder's settings are adjusted to be correct for dark areas so that areas inside the car will not be lost in the shadows.|Designed to be ultra-portable and ready to shoot in an instant, the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in lens shutter automatically opens when you turn it on, so that there is no need to remove and then keep track of a separate cap when the action begins. Simply power on the camera and the lens shutter slides open; power off and it slides shut, protecting the valuable Canon lens from dirt, dust and scratches.|Particularly useful for practicing office presentations or checking your golf swing, Mirror Image Recording/Playback mode flips the image horizontally to let you view a scene in real time as you watch a recording. Any dance student will immediately understand how much easier it is to follow and learn from a mirror image, but the feature is also useful for other kinds of applications, including rehearsing an office presentation or for an interview, perfecting a golf swing, following an intricate fitness routine and more – wherever you like and at your own pace. A Repeat Playback function lets you put a single file on a continuous loop for uninterrupted practice sessions.|Smart AUTO streamlines the recording of high-impact videos by intelligently selecting the best settings from 23 predefined groupings, in addition to the Sports, Snow, Beach, Night, Food and Fashion, Macro, and new In The Car Scene modes. Smart AUTO ensures that you capture clear, bright, well-focused video while the camcorder automatically chooses optimal settings and takes care of all system settings.

The Polar Pro Cube Red filter is designed for the GoPro Hero3 Black, Silver, and White Edition cameras. This red filter provides color correction when filming in blue and tropical waters. 

Why A Red Filter?
The GoPro's automatic white balance is fooled when filming at depths due to the lack of red light. The cameras ""brain"" thinks that all of the colors of the light spectrum are in front of it even though the red wavelength is missing. This causes the GoPro Hero3 to record videos which are too blue or too green. The Polar Pro Cube Red filter will filter out excess blue's and green's leaving behind vibrantly colored Videos.

When To Use? 
You will want to use your Red filter when filming at depths of 12 to 65 feet. When filming at the surface, simply snap the filter off and shoot without a filter. As you descend simply snap the filter on and capture the vibrant tropical colors! 

Why a Snap on Filter? 
A snap on filter gives you the most versatility when filming with a GoPro. Film inserts easily blow away, difficult to instal when outdoors, and get damaged easily. Our Snap On Filter is easy to clean, and installs/removes seamlessly in the field.

AEL6CQNQXONBX,B00KXAFYZS,Cute Chihuahua,"[0, 0]",0.0,"The Blurex Wireless-N Outdoor WiFi Rocket is one of the most interesting products that I have reviewed in recent months. This WiFi adapter has such a huge antenna on it that I think you could receive Wii in deep space. The total length of the antenna is about 18 inches long and is about a quarter inch wide at the tip and about an inch and a half wide at the bottom.First of all I want to clarify exactly how you use this adapter for those that may be unsure. I originally thought that this was like the typical WiFi range extender that you hook up and it boost your entire WiFi network. This adapter is connected to your computer and boosts the reception for that computer. It serves a very different purpose than I originally thought it would but it's still very useful, just in a different way. A Wii extender boosts your entire WiFi signal a little bit. This adapter boosts the range on one device very significantly.I have been using this adapter on my gaming laptop that is running Windows 8.1. Installation was a breeze and only took about a minute. It comes with a mini disk and you need to run setup and install the drivers. Once that is done you can plug it in and get started. From my living room my laptop usually has 5 bars and can pick up not only our connection but about ten of our neighbors WiFi signals. When I plug this adapter into my laptop it still has five bars but it can also pick up about 40 different connections around our house. When I take my laptop upstairs my signal is reduced drastically from 5 bars to 1 or 2 bars. My internet speed is greatly reduced upstairs as well. When I plug this adapter into my laptop upstairs it brings my bars back to 5 and my internet speed back to around what it is downstairs.Based on my experience it seems like this adapter will give you 3 or 4 times your normal range. That is very impressive and can come in really handy at times. There are times when we travel and utilize WiFi signals at hotels, airports and various different internet hot spots. These type of connections are notoriously slow and weak. This adapter is a awesome little tool for times like these. It includes a mounting bracket and cable ties if you wish to mount it but I just carry it around. It fits in the front pocket of my laptop bag and can be carried around. The price of this adapter is very reasonable for the quality of the hardware and it's strong performance. I would highly recommend this adapter, especially for the frequent traveler that carries a laptop.Sample provided for review.",5,Great portable adapter for picking up weak signals.

A2C1XRZGFO8WK9,B00DIFIM36,J. Linford,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I hate the fact that Comcast makes it cheaper for me to bundle basic cable with my broadband, and then wants me to pay $10 a month extra to get HD quality on channels I can get for free over the air.  Let me think... $120 a year versus $60 once...  Sorry Comcast, you lose!  (Plus, with an antenna I can record to a DVR or DVD recorder.  You can't do that with the basic cable box.)This is the third antenna I have tried and it's easily the best of the three!  The first was a basic set of rabbit ears with HD loop from Radio Shack, and the second was an amplified RCA 1450.  While they were both able to pick up ABC, CBS, Fox, and PBS, neither could get NBC, which broadcasts over Hi-V instead of UHF in my area and the tower is about 22 miles away from me.I had to try three spots with the Amazon Basic antenna, but I managed to find one where it can bring in the big 5 and their substations.  With the amplifier plugged in, the signal indicator on my TV tells me that the UHF stations come in with a strength of between 80 and 90 (out of 100).  The Hi-V NBC comes in at about 65.  It was not able to pick up a UHF station about 31 miles away, so I think the range is probably around 30 miles (although I did not try pointing the antenna directly at that tower because I care more about getting NBC than this other station).  The nearest towers are about 5 miles away, and even with the amplifier on they do not saturate.  [All my distances come from www.antennaweb.org.  I live in a fairly flat town with plenty of tress around.]While the antenna definitely works well, I suspect it is mainly because the extra long cable allows you to find the best spot.  I don't know that the super thin omni-directional design is really superior to other antennas out there, but it does look better.  Also, I'm almost certain that this is the exact same thing as the Winegard Flatwave Amped, just with Amazon branding instead.  If you look at the promotional pictures for each, they are exactly the same.Anyone looking to cut the cord, or just get better quality image and sound without paying the cable company extra, should definitely consider this antenna.",4,"Comcast killer: Good antenna, range of about 30 miles.",1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,i hate the fact that comcast makes it cheaper for me to bundle basic cable with my broadband and then wants me to pay a month extra to get hd quality on channels i can get for free over the air let me think a year versus once sorry comcast you lose plus with an antenna i can record to a dvr or dvd recorder you cant do that with the basic cable boxthis is the third antenna i have tried and its easily the best of the three the first was a basic set of rabbit ears with hd loop from radio shack and the second was an amplified rca while they were both able to pick up abc cbs fox and pbs neither could get nbc which broadcasts over hiv instead of uhf in my area and the tower is about miles away from mei had to try three spots with the amazon basic antenna but i managed to find one where it can bring in the big and their substations with the amplifier plugged in the signal indicator on my tv tells me that the uhf stations come in with a strength of between and out of the hiv nbc comes in at about it was not able to pick up a uhf station about miles away so i think the range is probably around miles although i did not try pointing the antenna directly at that tower because i care more about getting nbc than this other station the nearest towers are about miles away and even with the amplifier on they do not saturate all my distances come from i live in a fairly flat town with plenty of tress aroundwhile the antenna definitely works well i suspect it is mainly because the extra long cable allows you to find the best spot i dont know that the super thin omnidirectional design is really superior to other antennas out there but it does look better also im almost certain that this is the exact same thing as the winegard flatwave amped just with amazon branding instead if you look at the promotional pictures for each they are exactly the sameanyone looking to cut the cord or just get better quality image and sound without paying the cable company extra should definitely consider this antenna,hate fact comcast makes cheaper bundle basic cable broadband wants pay month extra get hd quality channels can get free air let think year versus sorry comcast lose plus antenna can record dvr dvd recorder cant basic cable boxthis third antenna tried easily best three first basic set rabbit ears hd loop radio shack second amplified rca both able pick abc cbs fox pbs neither could get nbc broadcasts hiv instead uhf area tower miles away mei try three spots amazon basic antenna managed find one where can bring big substations amplifier plugged signal indicator tv tells uhf stations come strength hiv nbc comes not able pick uhf station miles away so think range probably around miles although not try pointing antenna directly tower care more getting nbc than other station nearest towers miles away even amplifier not saturate all distances come live fairly flat town plenty tress aroundwhile antenna definitely works well suspect mainly extra long cable allows find best spot dont know super thin omnidirectional design really superior other antennas there look better also im almost certain exact same thing winegard flatwave amped just amazon branding instead look promotional pictures each exactly sameanyone looking cut cord just get better quality image sound without paying cable company extra should definitely consider antenna,21-Jul-14,2149,403,Electronics|Accessories & Supplies|Audio & Video Accessories|Antennas|TV Antennas,Home Audio & Theater,An Amazon Brand.,AmazonBasics Ultra-Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna - 25 Mile Range,AmazonBasics,,positive,0.9782,0.1304995443153338,0.2,positive

But so far, this bag sits nicely on my shoulders, but with my full equipment load, I can see how this can put a strain on my shoulder after several hours.Here's my breakdown:Positives:- Beautiful heavy duty bag.- Large with plenty of compartments and zippered pockets.- Separate camera container - easily removable when camera is not needed.- I can fit my Canon 5Diii, 24-70mm, 70-200mm, flash, some accessories and they all fit!

That's all in the past thanks to a little 4-in-1 gadget from HooToo. I have tested many of their products since about a year ago but this one is by far the coolest one that I have reviewed - I have seen nothing like it, honestly. That's why I want to introduce you all to the TripMate Elite (HT-TM04).What's in the Box?There's a ton to talk about from such a portable gadget but I want to also discuss what you also receive from inside the box:- Cheap Carrying Case- Never-Tangle USB to Micro USB Cable- User ManualThe basics for what you would normally expect from a gadget that is meant to be easy to carry, pack away, and take on-the-go.Where Does the HooToo TripMate Elite (HT-TM04) Exceed?The question is rhetorical when it comes to what makes this little gadget stand out from the competition. Basically, four main features makes the TripMate Elite different than the competition:- Personal Cloud- Travel Router- External Battery Pack- Dual USB AC ChargerI will go in-depth of all four features without spoiling any surprises since I can happily recommend this product to people like you - the average consumer. Let's start!Personal CloudI love using Google Drive, Dropbox, and recently fell in love with OneDrive but they don't give me a Personal Cloud for my local area network (LAN) in which only devices connected to the same network can access those file. In English, the TripMate allows you to connect an external USB storage device (i.e. USB Hard Drive) and those that are connected to your network (Wi-Fi) can only access it. This makes watching movies, listening to music, and viewing photos easier than ever.In my testing, I plugged the Sabrent USB Card Reader into the TripMate Elite and was able to share it with anyone on the network. I accessed my files on all my devices, such as; Apple iPod touch 4th Generation, ASUS Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy S4. There's one drawback that I must mention right now. You must own an iOS or/and Android device in order to access these files due to the requirement of downloading the official HooToo app that's only available in the App Store and Play Store. Otherwise, Windows Phone users are out of luck for the moment - I have yet to find a solution or workaround for this issue.Travel RouterTraveling is what I do and love to do; it's what makes living fun and adventurous. Except, when you return to your hotel/motel and notice that there's only one ethernet port available. The TripMate Elite fixes this little issue with it's built in Travel Router feature. This means you can connect it to the ethernet port (Note: Ethernet Cable Not Included) and share it to all of your devices with a custom password.In my testing, I was able to share my Internet directly from my router (Service Provider: AT&T) to all of my devices with no problems. The ability to connect was key and successful on my iPod touch 4th Generation, Lumia 810, Nexus 7 1st Generation, and both of my Windows 8.1 computers. Please be safe and understand that the Internet speed will all depend on the service provider.External Battery Pack & Dual USB AC ChargerAs people, we're always using our devices for pretty much anything; surfing the web, listening to music, or sharing a funny video. That's great and all but your battery is bound to die sooner or later. The TripMate Elite features a built-in battery that not only power itself but also charges your devices via two USB ports. Both pushes out the same amount of charge but one features 1.0 Amps while the other features 2.1 Amps. What's the difference? Well, the first one is able to charge your smartphone and small-battery devices quicker while the second one is able to charge your tablet, phablet, and bigger-battery devices quicker. If you misuse the ports and their labels your results won't be efficient.In my testing, it took about 30 minutes to charge my iPod touch 4th Generation, about 1 hour to charge my Lumia 810, and an hour and about 20 minutes to charge the Lumia 1020. All of these charges were completed with a single charge from the TripMate Elite and I didn't even have to recharge it for them all to receive a second helping of battery! Excellent work!Where Does the HooToo TripMate Elite (HT-TM04) Lack?The only flaw I managed to find was that there's no HooToo app for Windows Phone users leaving them from benefiting to access the personal cloud like those users with an iOS or/and Android device.How the HooToo TripMate Elite (HT-TM04) Fit in my Life?Ever since I received the TripMate Elite I have found traveling a bit less stressful and found the enjoyment of being able to stay connected to fun and play easier than ever - no matter what task is at hand.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Like I mentioned in the beginning, I highly recommend picking up this for yourself as a personal gift for you as well as the family.

A1VUGMDX51J2SW,B00B2HH7G0,Nick K.,"[0, 1]",0.0,"let me preface this by saying in the past I have had 60Hz monitors with a response time somewhere around 5ms, needless to say this is a major upgrade from the past.The monitor showed up in its base packaging, no exterior box around it to hide what was in it, which annoyed me but is no reason to take a star off from this product. inside it was padded with some Styrofoam and it had some thin plastic over the glossy parts so as to prevent smudges and initial damage from the factory. It also comes with an attachment at the base that helps to keep the power cord and the DVI Cable from being seen. There are three cords included in the packaging, a DVI Cable for video, an AUX Cable for the built in speakers, and of course the Power Cable. the AUX Cable feels rather cheap and probably won't hold up to much wear and tear, however both the power cord and the DVI Cable appear sturdy and of better quality. there are also ports available for other inputs such as HDMI, and Displayport, however it does NOT include those cables, it only includes a Dual-Link DVI Cable. One word of caution, although it may just be my cable, but I tried to plug an HDMI Cable in, but it would not transmit at the full 144Hz, it limited itself to about 60 Hz. it may have been my cable specificly but that is something to watch out for. The monitor comes with a CD that includes some software to manage and adjust various settings, however it is also available straight from the manufacturers website.Now for the features on this! The VG248QE Comes with a built in cross hair setting that displays either a Green or Red with two different types on the screen. I find this is cool in concept, even useful in games like Counter Strike, but I do have a couple of grievances. for one, the Red Crosshairs are offset by about a pixel to the right, this may be me being picky but that bothers the living daylights out of me! also I don't like how fancy the crosshairs are, I would personally prefer a simple + without all the other crap around it. And lastly I wish the image size was customizable. there is too much screen space taken up by it in my opinion, so adjusting the size would be nice! it comes with various preset monitor settings including, Theater, Gaming, Scenery, Night View, sRGB, and Standard. From what I can tell, the changes are as follows:Scenery Livens up the colors, making color's brighter, which you commonly seen done on professional photography level.Gaming brightens the colors as well but with less contrast, allowing you to see figures in the dark shadows. it also Sharpens the images, giving defining figuresI have not yet tested the other modes, so I can not comment on them.The screen itself moves 90 degree's clockwise, it will also swivel on its stand, be angled anywhere between 15 and -5 degrees and it can move up and down ~11cm. I love the way you move this monitor, its not jerky, and there don't appear to be any preset spots for it to sit, instead it almost flows when you adjust it up and down. I have also not had any issues of it falling down or repositioning itself in any way thus far. One slightly disappointing thing is that the Viewing angles seem rather narrow, and I find I can not have too many people crowd around it.Now onto the things everyone cares about. The Refresh rate. As I have previously stated up to this point every monitor I have owned has been a 60Hz monitor. Needless to say there is a large difference between 60 and 144 Hz. However I could not tell at first, simply because I forgot to go into NVidia's Control Panel and allow my G Card to go above 60 fps. Once I had that figured out, I don't think I will ever go back! The motions of moving, in game or in the browser are remarkably smooth, so much so that it was very unsettling at first. and everything on screen is so much clearer! your graphics card doesn't have to render blurred images because your producing more images each second, so they can be clearer, more precise. This improved refresh-rate made this monitor worth every penny!To Long? Didn't Read? Here's a quick Pro's Con's!Pros:144Hz1ms Response timemultiple preset screen settingsBuilt in crosshairLow in price compared with other 120/144Hz monitors24 InchesCons:Did not come with 3D GearNo USB

degrees and it can move up and down cm i love the way you move this monitor its not jerky and there dont appear to be any preset spots for it to sit instead it almost flows when you adjust it up and down i have also not had any issues of it falling down or repositioning itself in any way thus far one slightly disappointing thing is that the viewing angles seem rather narrow and i find i can not

(I also needed more HDMI ports). I wasn't really expecting that much of a difference between the two receivers-- Denon has always made pretty good amps. But I was blown away in three respects:1. The surround sound processing is much more accurate. You are enveloped in a much more accurate sound bubble than the Denon. Speakers generally seem much more responsive and tight.2. The stereo sound processing is incredible! The receiver really comes alive once you set it to Drama or Standard mode with lossless music via Airplay. The soundstage opens up and it sounds like you are in the center of an orchestra. It really does have a much wider soundstage than the Denon.3. The sheer number of customizable settings! This receiver allows for much more room-related flexibility than entry-level ones, and that is very useful.Of course, I'm sure Denon's mid-level receivers have these advantages. But I would have never suspected that spending $200 more on a receiver would bring with it so many benefits in sound!The only cons I could think of were that the setup was frustrating, and the remote is mind-bogglingly complicated. Good thing I'm using a Logitech Harmony remote.As a final note, this receiver is decently future-proofed. It can pass through 4K signals, and mine came with a Wifi adapter, so it has Airplay (very useful for lossless music streaming!) and automatic firmware updates.EDIT:Airplay is pretty unstable, but I think it is mostly the fault of the Wifi Adapter.

The nylon is 7 cm wide when closed, which allows you to put up to 10 cables inside the sleeve. That would turn that tangled, knotted mess of wires behind your desk into one organized group. Other solutions, like using tie-wraps or duct tape are annoyingly permanent, and can be very unsightly. By using Velcro to close the sleeve, it makes your wires easy to get to when needed. And by using a sleeve instead of ties, the wires look much more attractive.

One characteristic, that stands out, is the dual SD card slot, that can be programmed to use as a combined single storage unit, or better yet; as a main storage and a backup storage.  I prefer the latter...because if one card craps out...you've got a ready-made backup!  Also; while the built-in stereo mic is certainly not as good as an external shotgun mic, it is, in fact, superior to many other built-in mic's, in other camcorders.  Further; IF the price, of this puppy, may come down (thanks to newer technology, such as ""4K""...) then this Canon will be a great alternative, to a Sony 4K cam, for example.

As with all Canon high definition video lenses, aspherical lens technology is used to achieve low chromatic aberration with high resolution while maintaining compact dimensions. Super spectra coating technology lowers flare and ghosting. The VIXIA HF G30 breaks new ground with its 8-Blade Circular Aperture, which reduces the “starburst” effect found in camcorders with non-circular apertures. The result is that points of light in out-of-focus areas, usually the background of your shot, are beautifully circularly blurred, creating a more authentic and artistic feel. The professional touch of a manual focus ring allows accurate and precise control. For extra flexibility, the manual focus ring can be easily set to control zoom instead.|The VIXIA HF G30 gives you the highest quality recording, whether you’re capturing MP4 or AVCHD files. 1080/60p recording captures twice the amount of information as 60i, and with images captured at a rate of 60 frames per second, diagonal noise is virtually eliminated so even fast moving subjects show up crisply with motion and patterns clearly recorded. This greater sense of detail and faithful rendering of moving edges, plus enhanced color and fine tonal gradation, gives your video everything Full HD has to offer. With the VIXIA HF G30 you can record in internet-ready, easy-to-share MP4 format at up to 35 Mbps.

So, regardless of the format you’re shooting or viewing, image quality is outstanding.|The VIXIA HF G30 features the Native 24p Progressive Mode, generally found only on Canon’s professional camcorders. The mode allows 24 frames per second to be captured and recorded (instead of the standard 60i) – a look that is evocative of traditional cinematic quality, and a must for serious filmmaking work.|The VIXIA HF G30 allows you to record in a different frame rate than the one you play back in, adding a fast or slow motion effect to your captured video. Speed up your video 250% or slow it down to 40% to revel in every moment of that game-winning goal. There is no loss in image quality so you’ll see everything you saw before – only faster or slower.|Built-in, dual-band (5 GHz/2.4 GHz) Wi-Fi® technology on the VIXIA HF G30 lets you share your HD video easily, and in a number of different ways.

And, because it is positioned where your thumb naturally rests while holding the camera, you can shoot and adjust easily – even with one hand!|The VIXIA HF G30 allows you to record video directly to widely available SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards with capacities ranging from over 32GB to 2TB. They are available in ultra-fast reading and writing speeds and make it easy to share video. Plus, dual slots on the VIXIA HF G30 enable Relay Recording. The camcorder automatically switches to the second memory card when the first becomes full, so there’s no need to worry about running out of recording time during a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime shot.| |Dual Recording and built-in transcoding help ensure that you’ll have the right format available for your needs. Using the power of the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor, the VIXIA HF G30 camcorder can simultaneously record video in AVCHD format to one SD card, and in MP4 format to the other SD card^. The widely used MP4 format provides quick, conversion-free playback on tablets and smartphones, and lets you upload videos directly to social networking sites for easy sharing with friends, family and the world. AVCHD is perfect for watching videos on an HDTV or archiving them to Blu-ray discs. The camcorder also has a built-in transcoding function that converts AVCHD files to MP4s, or from MP4 to MP4 across memory media, making them easy to upload to the Web or save to an SD card.|^ Simultaneous recording is not supported when using MP4 (35 Mbps), AVCHD Progressive (28 Mbps) or Cinema-Look Filters.|Canon’s sophisticated SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer corrects camera shake instantly, so even handheld video taken at long focal lengths is sharp and steady.

Depending on the background color of your shot, you can choose between two different colors for better viewing contrast.|Canon helps you get more out of your camcorder with a range of accessories that inspire creativity and productivity. One such example is the Canon Wireless Microphone WM-V1, which streams audio wirelessly from subjects up to 164 feet away. It’s perfect for adding your subject’s voice at times when you can’t get in close to shoot, and can also be used as a stand-alone transceiver to cue shooting and more.|To enhance focusing capability, the VIXIA HF G30 also features Focus Assist. Normally found in professional broadcast-quality cameras, this feature helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject, which is automatically cancelled when you start recording.|Videographers with exacting needs will appreciate the VIXIA HF G30’s range of functions designed to pinpoint focus adjustment, exposure control, and help you get professional-level quality from the camcorder.

After pairing the speaker with my Android phone as device ""TREK Max,"" I streamed some classical music from iHeartRadio, then went through one of my favorite playlists of mixed music. Everything I played sounded excellent. I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since the days of 78 RPM phonograph records, so I've played music over a lot of different speakers, and the sound from the TREK Max A34 is as rich as I've heard from a small portable speaker, and at maximum volume, the 15 watts total sound will easily fill any room in most homes. I checked the stereo channel balance and separation and verified that the left and right channels were playing through the corresponding speakers, which they were. The controls are very intuitive for anyone who's familiar with Bluetooth speakers, and none of the controls have the double functions that are so confusing with many portable speakersThe Bluetooth range and stability were good, with a line of sight distance of at least 25-30 feet before I noticed any dropouts. With a couple of interior walls between my phone and the speaker, however, the range was reduced to as little as 20 feet. If you have the speaker paired with your mobile phone, it works as a hands-free device with a built-in microphone. One press of a button on the speaker, and you're connected to an incoming call.The product description refers to the TREK Max 34 as being water resistant with an IP64 rating. International Protection Marking codes, also known as IP codes, classify and rate the degree of protection provided against the intrusion of dust and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. The IP64 rating is fairly high, signifying that the case is dustproof, and that it provides protection against splashing water.I didn't see the capacity of the speaker's built-in battery listed in the user manual or the product description, but the run time is listed as up to 8 hours. I checked this after charging the speaker's battery, and it played for just over 8 hours before the battery died.The TREK Max A34 speaker has the best sound I've heard in a portable speaker in this price range. At 2.7 pounds, it's not as easily portable as smaller speakers weighing less than a pound, but the audio quality more than makes up for the extra weight and size.

A1NGFGBX2VCQS8,B00HY5IOKM,Ralph Furlong,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I am always looking for a better case for my iPad Air as I use it everywhere.  Most recently, I used it while on a cruise to view and edit pictures while I was in each port to ensure I had what I wanted.  So, when this case became available, I jumped at trying it.  Here is what I liked:1.  The fit is exact!  That being said, there is NO room for the protective cover when this cover is put on.  If I was doing it again (ruined the one that was included) I would trim it so that the cover would not make contact with it.2.  The case is EASY to see which helps to prevent you from leaving it!!!  Black cases look nice, but they blend in which makes it easy to forget.3.  The adjustable stand works easily and has a locking mechanism to keep it closed that is easy to release and easy to set.4.  The case is very soft and should protect the iPad from all but a direct drop onto the screen on a projecting object.  The thickness is such that drops onto a flat surface should be fine since the rubber projects beyond the screen.  It just would not help if you dropped it onto a rock or something like that.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  The screen protector should be trimmed enough to allow the case to fit without peeling up the edges of it.2.  The stand is hard plastic and can scratch a surface that it is placed on.  It would have been nice if they had put a rubber coating on it so that it did not scratch.  Note:  This is why I deducted one star from the review.3.  This cover adds considerable bulk and weight to the iPad.  It is also not the easiest to put on and to take off.Overall, I like the design as it does what it was intended to do, protect the iPad in situations where it is subject to rough use.  So, if you are using this on a factory floor or out on photo shoots, this case may be what you are looking for.

The problem I have is that when I connect a table of phone to this charger it takes about 15-30 seconds for the device to respond and give a guestimation of how much the device is charged.  Sometimes the device does not even respond with this information leaving me wondering if it is charging or not; but when I come back later it has more of the battery indicator filled in.  So basically now I just plug it in and hope for the best because I cannot tell if it is charging or not.

I mean everything was perfect... However, where this laptop disappoints is in the key functional areas.The first thing i noticed was the track pad, absolutely rubbish, you have to click right in the corner and hard for it to register a click..and double tapping on the trackpad never opened anything for me unless it was two hard clicks in the corner, not a problem when you use a mouse while sitting at your desk but if your in bed or moving about and use the track pad, well then prepare to be frustrated, because i updated to the latest drivers but and checked all the settings but nothing helped.The second problem i have is the keyboard, i only really get time to use the laptop at night so backlit keys are very important to me, however, silver keys with white lights,really?!? and the light bleed from underneath the keys was bad enough to cause constant glare and irritated my eyes.And the third problem, which was absolutely riddiculous was the speakers, i dont even use laptop speakers much but Bang and Olfsun ??? Really?? My 8 year old HP has better sound quality with regular speakers, the sub woofer is a gimmick and nothing else, it does change the sound but that does not mean its great sounding..The harddrive was also slow, but to be honest i like the idea of manufacturers using cheap slow hard drives to keep the costs down and give us more of the good stuff like the displays and the graphics, most people switch to ssd's now anyways..Other than that this laptop was great but i have an issue when functionality is compromised and for me the track pad and the keys and the speakers and the weight, much heavier than my old hp envy 15.6... and very poor battery life for a new laptop, i was always having to plug in.. For the price its perfect but if these things matter to you then be careful.. I wish they had atleast kept the keys black i mean that is the worst.. Im now getting an HP Envy with the same graphics card but slower processor, however , i know the track pad , the keys and all the things that are important will shine.. at the end of the day , you need to be able to use your laptop without being frustrated, rather than it being barely slower than another laptop.

With each eye having its own display isolated from the other eye, there is zero crosstalk.As for the negatives...Comfort isn't great.  It's possible to make it very comfortable, but this often impacts the image quality.  In order to get the best quality, I really had to ratchet it down against my forehead to limit the movement of the device and force my eyes as close to the lenses as possible.  The greater the distance between your eyes and the lenses, the harder it is to get good focus on the entire image.  If you wear glasses, be careful.  I tried it briefly with mine instead of my contacts and couldn't get it to fit correctly at all due to the way the frames of the glasses physically came into contact with the viewer.Not all of the accessories are well thought out.  The light blockers, in particular, are prone to simply falling off.  I would state that the cables are very cumbersome, but that's expected since this wasn't really intended as a portable device.The screens are only 720p.  This is very noticeable given the level of magnification used to try and produce a large screen experience.  When using the viewer with a PC, the pixel structure was very apparent, particularly on text and small graphics.  The effect was also readily apparent when watching movies.  The 720p screens may be in part due to the lack of 60Hz 3D support at 1080p over HDMI 1.4 with many devices.I had a difficult time getting the entire image in focus.  There was always one corner that was blurry, though the particular corner would vary with the adjustments.  This was very noticeable with text and games, less so with movies but still very annoying.  The eye adjustments are not precise enough and the range of adjustment is too limited to completely solve the problem.I could probably live with the above, if not for the single biggest deal breaker...The light from the screens illuminates the viewing lenses and the entire path from the lenses to the screens.  It's literally like you're looking down a tunnel at the screens because you can see everything in-between.  This completely ruins the illusion of having a large screen in front of you.  If they could find a way to keep everything between your eye and the screens completely dark, then this could realistically feel like a large screen directly in front of you.I know this product has

I purchased Corsair RAM from their approved list, and I am having problems booting up.  The build will start, then immediately shut down and start up again.  I've been told it might be the RAM, even though the RAM is on their list.  (It might be that the ""Revision No"" of the RAM is not on their list, but how in the world can we as consumers know which RAM revision we are buying?Also, in my opinion, the BIOS programs appear to be untested and not ready for consumer use.

Generally speaking, I've been pleased with its performance.  However, Lenovo recently pushed out a system upgrade from version 4.2 Jellybean to 4.4 Kit Kat, and feedback on the Lenovo forum has not been good.  According to the posters, not only does the 4.4 upgrade not function properly, but there appears to be no way to downgrade to version 4.2 again.

AQM0K7MBBT4AY,B00J49ZH56,B. Rose,"[1, 1]",1.0,"This is my first laptop. Before I owned this, I was gung-ho about desktop PCs being the way to go. Now, I'm a convert. This laptop combines so much power / capability into a compact and convenient form factor that I never really bother to use my desktop PC anymore. Rather than do an exhaustive review like the major review sites, I'll cover the major perks (and drawbacks, if there are any) I've noticed so far.DESIGN / AESTHETICS / ERGONOMICS:+ the laptop has a dark matte-blue anodized aluminum body. It's fairly heavy-duty while retaining a 'premium' look and feel+ the keyboard is comfortable for my adult male hands and I have no issues typing. Key presses are shallow, but perceptible. The backlit keyboard is a huge plus for using the laptop in a dim room+ super thin form factor. This is basically almost as thin as a tablet. Definitely thinner than a paper notebook and will fit in your bag no problemPERFORMANCE:+ 8GB RAM is more then sufficient for my purposes (everything short of heavy gaming)+ 256GB solid-state hard drive lets me store all my music, pictures, and plenty of movies/games (I 'archive' the stuff I'm not going to use on an external drive), and boots / awakens from sleep in seconds:: on-chip graphics card is sufficient for movies and lightweight gaming but you won't be using this laptop for the newest games, as the graphics card isn't replaceable+ the laptop stays cool and is whisper-quiet at all times. I've never noticed it heating up or heard any fan noise above the faintest whisper, and then only when I had it running some demanding editing softwareOPERATING SYSTEM:+ Windows 8 was a bit of an adjustment for me, but I have to admit it's a lot more efficient than Vista. The OS on this laptop has the classic Windows 7-style desktop as well, so you don't have to rely on the mobile OS-like Windows 8 home screen if you don't want to. I found the new OS is actually pretty intuitive, once you give it a chance+ swiping the right of the screen to bring up settings / connections is pretty convenient. I find it a lot easier than worrying about navigating manually to & through the Control Panel+ updating apps / drivers is really easy with the Samsung SW Update appDISPLAY:+ the display is gorgeous. Vivid colors, great depth,  extremely clear and high-resolution. The brightness range is great -- at full brightness, I can use it in full sunlight; at lowest setting, it's just bright enough to use in a dark room and save power+ Windows 8 makes it really easy to project to a second monitor, or another device...+ this laptop comes with WiDi. If you have a WiDi receiver, you can broadcast your laptop's display to the receiver (and through that, to your TV) with a swipe and a button press. It's awesome! I use my laptop to watch movies on my TV with a cheap WiDi receiver... it takes 10 seconds for me to have full HD streaming video/audio to my TV directly from my laptopFEATURES / ETC:+ the capacitive touchscreen is just awesome. It really, really works with Windows 8 and is often so much more convenient and efficient than using a keyboard and mouse in many cases. The only downside is...- the touchscreen gets smudges / fingerprints and has to be cleaned occasionally, and I know the smudges will drive some people crazy+ built-in memory card reader is convenient for pulling files off your mobile devices if you don't want to do so wirelessly+ USB 3 port enables rapid charging of your USB-3 enabled phone or tablet+ HDMI-out for quick compatibility with modern monitors or TVs; also a mini-VGA out for older displays+ no optical drive -- saves power and makes the laptop thinner+ Battery Life is beyond the advertised value... I can stretch mine for 10+ hours if I keep it on low brightness. With heavier internet/video usage and medium brightness, this lasts more like 6-7 hours. It's about the same as a smartphone. If you use this lightly and put it to sleep in between uses, it'll last you a few days at a time.- there was a lot of Samsung bloatware on here when I first ran it, including the especially annoying Smart Assistant thing (additional toolbar that's always on the screen), but it was easy to uninstall... about 15 minutes of searching and uninstalling and I'm happy now with the apps I have running+ audio quality is surprisingly good for a super-thin laptop. I had this playing music in a hotel room a while back and was pretty impressed. It's no boombox, but the music volume is sufficient.+ the trackpad is generous, providing plenty of room even for my somewhat large hands. You can do a number of gestures (two fingers spreading apart/coming together to zoom out/in, or two fingers in unison to scroll the page up/down/sideways) that basically render a mouse unnecessary+ bluetooth means I can use this with the same headphones I have for my cell phones+ If you have a Samsung phone, you can also click it against the right side of the screen (with NFC enabled) and instantly sync your devicesBOTTOM LINE:This laptop is AWESOME. The CPU is a beast, there's a ton of RAM, the SSD is fast and capacious, the display is gorgeous, the battery life is formidable, it's lightweight, slim, yet surprisingly solid, and comes with a bunch of SW (some useful, some bloatware, but that's easily uninstalled). It boots / awakens in seconds, it's quiet, and so far has been absolutely stable (no crashes / freezes / slowdowns at all). It's especially convenient with my Samsung smartphone (I have a Galaxy SIII now) and my WiDi receiver. I see myself using this for years to come. 5 stars.",5,Sleek and powerful all-purpose laptop with a beautiful touchscreen display,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,this is my first laptop before i

They're decently quiet and provide adequate airflow while at low speeds.  They work correctly with the PWM headers on my motherboard, which varies the speed according to temperature.  Conveniently, I have significant radiator surface area and these fans have good airflow, so these will often remain at their lowest speed and stay quiet even while the system is under heavy load.  In fact, they show minimal difference in temperature between their lowest speed and the highest, but this will vary depending upon your setup.  Unfortunately, I cannot attest to their performance in a strictly air-cooled environment, but I see no reason they wouldn't be effective.The included rubber bumpers on the screw holes are a nice touch for keeping noise from vibrations down.  The interchangeable colored rings are also a nice touch, but I'm not sure how many people will be inclined to use them.

AGEKVD8JPZQMT,B00JXFM75Y,"M. Rodriguez ""Cnyper""","[0, 0]",0.0,"This is a good player for your home media files, but it's not perfect.  It works, and it works pretty well so i'm giving it three stars (I like it).  I am not giving it four stars (I love it) because, well, I don't love it.  That doesn't mean this is a bad product, it does everything as advertised.  I turned it on, it asked to connect to my wifi network, I set it up and voila, easy-peasy.Now here's where it depends on your network.  If you already have a home media server on your network, then it should detect all your media files that you have shared.  My issue: all my files are shared on my 5GHz network.  This thing only operates on the 2.4GHz band.  Since my router splits the two as different networks, it didn't see my files.  So i manually reconnected one to the 2.4GHz band and it worked.  The quality was good, too.  I didn't try multiple types of files, but the one I tried worked fine.  If you have requests just let me know in the comments section and I'll test it.I don't care to use this because all my stuff is on the 5GHz network, and I don't care to go back to my 2.4GHz network.  It would be equivalent to changing all my home theater devices from HDMI down to component video inputs - I have a 1080 TV and components, why would I downgrade all of them to support one peripheral?Furthermore, my only useful app out of the box is Vudu.  There is HuluPlus, which I don't subscribe to, and YouTube which I never use.  And then there's CinemaNow, which is basically the same exact thing as Vudu, but prettier.I like the interface better than my Roku, and the fact that you can connect a USB drive to download media onto (in the case you buy/rent movies from apps like CinemaNow) and stream directly from your home network would have made this thing five stars . . . . but come on, no Netflix?  No Amazon Video?  Deal breaker.  This will probably sit in my random electronics drawer until I find a better use for it.

The Black Edition is a bit more money but has more shooting options and currently is the flagship of the GoPro camera's. I own traditional cameras (DSLR, point and shoot, video, etc.) but with a GoPro you can actually ""have fun"" with. There's no being careful with it because you can be tough with it and can take it into anything you can't take traditional cameras into (underwater, etc.). The fact you can mount it on different things makes it very unique. There are other action cams but GoPro right now is the highest rated and most popular. I read recently that TV shows and commercials (probably movies to for that matter) are now being shot with GoPro's...so go figure. I'm not an action junky by no means but I bike ride occasionally but use this mainly for family weekend getaways, vacations, in the backyard, and most importantly making memories (from a non traditional camera standpoint) with my 1 year old daughter. If you have kids, having a GoPro is great to have because even the kids can play with it.If you have the money get the Hero3+ Black Edition, otherwise there is the silver and white editions to save some money.

Some with keyboards, some without.  Some by Kensington, some by Logitech and some from no-name Chinese outlets.  This is the first one I've left on my iPad Air for over a few weeks.It isn't perfect.  But it is pretty good.  First off - protection.  The case is VERY good in this area and protects the sides of the iPad very well.  I would imagine that this would protect your iPad in MOST falls.The case looks nice, and feels nice.  Unlike some cases I have tried, the magnetic flap doesn't beat the screen to death. In fact, there is no magnetic clasp hanging off of the case.  It simply closes and the magnet holds it closed.This case does use the magnetic lock that turns on the screen.  I find that even moving it a little turns the iPad on, probably wasting battery life.  That would be one of the down sides of this case.It also doesn't prop up well, certainly not any better than the many other cases I have tried.  Like most of them, the indentations aren't deep enough to really prop the iPad up for angled viewing.  Another downside of the case.So why do I give it five stars?  It is simply the first case I have found so far that works well enough for me to keep it.  It doesn't do anything particularly amazingly, but it does most everything well enough and most importantly, it doesn't do anything so bad that it becomes a deal breaker.I know that doesn't sound like a sales pitch, and I'm not trying to pitch this case.  I'm just saying that I've tried a lot of cases and so many of them had fatal flaws that forced me to abandon them after a short time.

A3207X61DYO1RR,B00F3SOHNU,JY,"[1, 1]",1.0,"I've been using this tablet for about a month or so now, and I've gotta say it is still one of the best tablets out there and can stand the test of time for the next two to three years.Many reviews already covered this tablet's usefulness, especially with regards to the S pen, so I won't go in depth here.  I bought this tablet with the intention of using the S pen, and it has not dissapointed me so far.  This feature is a must for anyone who reads a lot of PDFs or need a centralized place to keep notes that is not a forgotten spiral bound notebook.It's almost August at the time of this review, how does this tablet compare to the current competition?1. The iPad Air.  Apple's flagship tablet has plenty to brag about.  Many tests out there will show that it is very speedy, and even though it's only got 2 cores, the way Apple has engineered it to be optimized with the OS shows that you don't need the beefiest specs to deliver a great experience.  The iPad Air wins slightly on the experience since there is some lag with the stock TouchWiz UI that Samsung's included in the tablet.  Both tablets have very sharp screen, and the colors are vibrant.  But I think if you need to read a lot of PDFs and annotate, you can't go wrong with the Note 2014.2. Samsung's other Tab S line.  Samsung's been pushing out tablets like bunnies. I think they've announced at least two or three times already of new tablets hitting the market since January!  The S line, especially with the latest Tab S, is focused on the display while the older (even though they're not even a year old!) Tab Pro line focused on beefing up the specs.  If you don't need the S pen, they are more than adequate for everyday entertainment and productivity.3. Asus tablets... was the last Asus Android tablet (other than the 7 inch ones) the transformer infinity?  After using some of their tablets, I've decided that there are so many quality control issues and kinks that don't get worked out that I've given up on them. This sentiment is only for Asus's own tablets.  All of their Google affiliated tablets, like the Nexus line, has been fantastic.4.  What about the 7 or 8 inch tablets?  Each form factor has its use. I find the smaller tablets are great for on the go reading and some note taking (Note 8).  But, if you want to really annotate and take notes, the 10 inch version is the best way to go.5.  Note Pro 12.2?  Even though the Note Pro is not that much bigger physically, I feel that at the 12 inch screen, you might as well use your laptop.  I'm viewing the tablet still as somewhat of a portable device.  The one thing that I do like about the 12 inch tablet though is the fact that there is ACTUALLY some accessory support!  The biggest caveat to buying a note 10.1 and the reason why it's only a 4/5 is that there are no quality accessories, mainly keyboard options.  So far, only Belkin has made a keyboard case worthy of consideration. This is their universal QODE keyboard, but it's not really tailored for the Note 10.1 (even though all the cutouts are there), and there are definitely nicer keyboards for other tablets like the S line, the Pro line, and the iPad Air.TL;DR: Great tablet if you need the S pen, even considering the competition.

A2CQABVHIP3WWG,B00747Y9C2,Anonymous,"[0, 0]",0.0,"HARDWAREIf the Mac Pro really does look like a trash can, as everyone says, it's much nicer than any rubbish bin I've ever owned. Starting with the shape, which seems to have earned it so much ridicule, the Mac Pro is basically a squat little cylinder, with a large circular opening up top where the heat creeps out. Between that and the glossy gunmetal ""Space Gray"" finish, it does indeed look like some sort of futuristic wastepaper basket.Then, of course, you turn the thing around and notice the Apple logo, power button and a cutout in the anodized-aluminum exposure, making it easy to access the various ports. Not exactly a garbage can, that. All told, the Mac Pro is a compact little thing, standing 9.9 inches tall and measuring 6.6 inches in diameter. For whatever reason-- the photography on Apple's site, perhaps -- it feels smaller and shorter than I imagined it. To give you some perspective, the Pro stands around half as tall as a 27-inch monitor, like Apple's own Cinema Display, and has roughly the same footprint as an office phone. So if you have room for a landline, you almost certainly have room for the Mac Pro. And if you have enough room for a landline, you can probably get away with using the Mac Pro in other small spaces, like a music stage or the corner of a film set.Speaking of the sort, the machine is light enough, at 11 pounds, that you could conceivably take it with you to your next shoot. Left uncovered, you'll want to handle it gingerly, of course, but if you keep the original box with the foam inserts, you should have no problem carrying it in the crook of your arm. In fact, that might not be such a bad idea: The glossy aluminum finish is also quite the fingerprint magnet, much more so than any other Apple products we've seen. If you do carry this around by hand, be prepared to wipe off some smudges now and again.Swinging back to the ports for a moment, these include headphone and mic jacks, four USB 3.0 sockets, six Thunderbolt 2 connections, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and an HDMI 1.4 port. As a nice, even more futuristic touch, the power button glows white briefly when you turn on the machine, as do a few other accent lights around the ports. The LEDs even fade as you shut down the computer, and flick on again one by one as it's booting up. Additionally, you'll find a locking switch that keeps the removable aluminum enclosure in place (you can't actually power on the machine unless the cover is on). One thing you won't find here: a memory card slot. This makes sense, in a way, given that pros aren't big on SD cards, and there are simply too many other formats to accommodate on one small chassis. To build in, say, a CF slot, but not one for XQD would have been rather arbitrary indeed.INTERNALSSix paragraphs so far and I've only described the removable case. Slip it off and you get to the heart of the machine, a tall, three-sided board Apple is calling the ""thermal core."" Two of the sides are taken up by the GPUs -- dual graphics cards are standard here -- whereas the CPU occupies the third. I'll get to performance and configuration options in a moment, but for now, suffice to say you can configure this thing with two AMD FirePro D700 GPUs and 12GB of video memory, amounting to up to seven teraflops of computing power (the last Mac Pro maxed out at 2.7 teraflops). Meanwhile, there are two RAM banks (with two slots each), located on either side of the CPU board. Combined, these can accommodate up to 64GB of DDR3 memory, with bandwidth of up to 60 gigabytes per second.With the exception of the processor, everything is user-replaceable -- the RAM, the GPUs and the solid-state storage. (I still wouldn't recommend that the average person replace the GPU himself, but then again, the Mac Pro isn't exactly for the average consumer in the first place.)Speaking of thermal performance -- this is the thermal core, after all -- Apple designed a cooling system whereby air is sucked in at the base of the machine, and gets pushed out of that large hole in the top. Rather than use multiple fans, Apple went with just one, tweaking the size, shape, speed and spacing of the blades. In the end, the company's engineering team settled on backward-curved impeller blades, which spin at fewer revolutions per minute than on the last-gen Mac Pro.The idea, of course, is for the blades to effectively cool the system, but also to make less noise in the process. According to Apple, the new Pro reaches 15 decibels while under load, versus 30dB on the last edition. And when the machine is idle, it simmers down to just 12dB -- very similar to the lower-powered Mac mini. As I'll discuss later in the review, the machine is indeed as quiet as advertised, though that may or may not come at the expense of some warm operating temperatures.PERFORMANCEThough the unit we have here is very nearly an entry-level configuration (quad-core Intel Xeon E5-1620 processor, 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, dual 2GB AMD FirePro D300 GPUs), I also had the chance to test out a more tricked-out version. That was an $8,099 model with an eight-core CPU, 64GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and two FirePro D700 GPUs -- the best graphics Apple is offering. With the newest version of Final Cut Pro X, which has been specifically optimized to take advantage of the Mac Pro's dual GPUs, I saw the machine play back 16 picture-in-picture 4K streams simultaneously.Editing is a seamless affair too -- you can apply a filter to a video and see it go into effect immediately. Zero rendering time here. Ditto for previews: You can instantly see how an effect will look without having to wait for the machine to catch up. Last example: Retiming a four-and-a-half-minute clip to just a few seconds was also instantaneous -- I could immediately play back a much shorter version of that same footage. I'm no videographer, as you all know, but if I were, it would be nice not to have to wait while I had a director or client looking over my shoulder, asking me to make changes. (Because in my fantasy life as a videographer, I'm always on location.)Fortunately, you don't need an $8,100 configuration to enjoy that kind of performance. Even on the more modestly specced machine, I was able to preview and apply effects and transitions with zero waiting time. As on the higher-end model, I could play back multiple 4K streams at once. Additionally, I was able to add effects to clips while playing back my project, and could immediately jump to that clip to see the effect in action. At one point, I went a little overboard and added 15 filters and the footage still ran flawlessly. (N.B.: There's an option in settings that causes playback to stop as soon as a frame drops, but that never happened during my testing. Not once.) Truth be told, I probably could have applied even more than 15 effects, but by that time, I had conceded defeat, and was starting to feel bored with my little game.Other stats: Importing a 9.23GB folder of .MOV files from the desktop took less than two seconds -- I had barely pressed the start button on my stopwatch and the import was already over. When it came time to export, exporting that 9.23GB project from ProRes 422 to H.264 took five minutes and 16 seconds. As a side note, when I timed the export, I made sure I wasn't doing anything else in Final Cut Pro, since the program is designed to slow background processes if there's something going on in the foreground. That said, I found that I could play other 4K clips while exporting a project, though at one point I hit a clip that included a 4K picture-in-picture overlay, which caused a brief slowdown.I won't dwell too much on benchmark scores here, for the simple reason that most tests have not yet been optimized to take advantage of dual GPUs. As you can see in the above table, for instance, the numbers are on par with a recent iMac, even though the real-world performance here is far superior, especially in apps like Final Cut Pro X, which have been designed to leverage both graphics cards. Meanwhile, our test system ran the Cinebench R15 Open GL test at 74 frames per second -- that, too, is a good showing, but still not as fast as you'd expect of a dual-GPU machine.It's a similar story with gaming: I ran Batman: Arkham City (the Game of the Year Edition), but suspect it was using just one of the GPUs. With resolution set to 2,560 x 1,440, details on high and anti-aliasing at its highest setting (8x), the Mac Pro managed an average of 56 frames per second, with frame rates running the gamut from 28 to 83 fps. It wasn't until I dropped the anti-aliasing and detail levels to medium that I saw rates climb to 60 frames per second, with a peak of 88 fps. Even then, that was only a modest improvement. In the Mac Pro's defense, though, gameplay is smooth, especially if you disable V Sync, which caps frame rates. The performance just isn't quite as robust as you'd expect on a machine this powerful.Without belaboring the point, this brings me to one of my few concerns about the Mac Pro, which is that right now, at least, most programs won't fully harness its graphics capabilities. One of the reasons I spent so much time in Final Cut Pro is that it's one of the few programs designed specifically to run well on a new Mac Pro. It reminds me a bit of how Retina display MacBook Pros were initially short on compatible software. If that analogy holds true, we should see more apps retooled to play nice with the Mac Pro's dual-GPU setup. Just be prepared for some slim pickings if you buy one this week.As for tasks that aren't GPU-intensive, start-up consistently took around 46 seconds -- a moot point if you're one of those people who never shuts down before leaving the office. (If you do shut down regularly, you might find the boot-up sequence slightly tedious, though you'll of course make up for it in rendering time.) Copying a nearly 10GB file from the downloads folder to the desktop was basically instantaneous. Most apps launched with virtually zero wait time. Even Final Cut Pro, a fairly heavy-duty program, was up and running in under three seconds.Throughout, the Mac Pro gets a bit warm, but it's rarely hot, and it's always quiet. For lack of a better word, you'd have to provoke the machine to really be bothered by the heat: The warmest area is at the top of the chassis, and even then, you'd have to be sticking your hand near the vents to feel it. Otherwise, the chassis does get a tad warm -- and can take a while to cool down -- but it's much cooler than the air blowing out of the top. Avoid sticking your fist into the opening at the top and you'll be fine. As for noise, I tried hard to get the fans spinning, but they stayed quiet. Actually, if you put your ear up to the opening at the top, you will hear a faint purring, but again, you'd have to be the sort of wise guy willing to put your ear next to the hottest part of the machine (not recommended).It's no surprise that with a high-performing machine like this, Apple went with SSDs built on the PCI Express standard. (In fact, all of its new machines, laptop and desktop alike, use PCIe.) In this case, though, the speeds are rated for 1.2GB per second, versus 800 MB/s on, say, the MacBook Air or the entry-level Retina display MacBook Pro. So, whereas the disk speeds are good on Apple's other machines, they're positively screaming here. As you can see in the above table, our read speeds averaged 918.6 MB/s across different stress loads, with write speeds coming out to 761.2 MB/s. To put that in perspective, the newest iMac managed 667.88 MB/s on the read test, and just 318.14 MB/s when it came to write speeds. Big difference, wouldn't you say?In addition to the SSD, the Thunderbolt 2 ports bring some serious speed of their own. Thanks to their bandwidth of 20 Gbps, you can daisy-chain up to six peripherals per port, or 36 for the whole machine. Or, you can connect up to three 4K monitors. I wish I could've tested that last bit, but alas, our reviews budget doesn't stretch far enough to include three of those bad boys. One would be sweet enough.CONFIGURATION OPTIONSAnd here we arrive at what's actually one of the more important sections of this review: the part where we tell you all the ways you can trick out your new beast of a workstation. On Apple's site, you'll see two ready-made models, both of which are scheduled to ship in February. The base version goes for $2,999 with a quad-core 3.7GHz Intel Xeon E5 processor, dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs with 2GB of VRAM each, 12GB of memory and a 256GB PCIe SSD. In other words, it's basically the same unit I tested, except ours had 16 gigs of RAM instead of 12. Otherwise, same specs.The other model listed on Apple's site is a six-core unit with dual FirePro D500 GPUs. As a higher-end machine, this has 3GB of video memory per GPU, not two. Additionally, it comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, just like the base model.But don't be fooled by the simplicity of Apple's purchasing page. Click ""select"" for either and you'll be opening up a wide array of customization options. And really, that's what you're most curious about, right? Let's unpack all the choices here. For starters, if you're configuring the lower-end quad-core model, you can step up to a six-core CPU ($500), an eight-core one ($2,000) or a 12-core chip ($3,500). From there, you can upgrade to 16GB ($100), 32GB ($500) or 64GB ($1,300) of RAM. As for storage, there are larger 512GB and 1TB SSDs available for $300 and $800, respectively. Finally, there's graphics. In addition to the base option, which includes two 2GB FirePro D300 GPUs, you can opt for two 3GB D500s ($400) or two 6GB D700s ($1,000).Obviously, the upgrade prices are different if you start with the higher-end model. Regardless, the Mac Pro always comes with dual GPUs, as I said, along with other amenities like 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0, neither of which was included on the last-gen Mac Pro.If you still have room in your budget, Apple is also selling a $3,595, 32-inch 4K Sharp monitor on its site, in case you don't already have a screen for viewing and playing back ultra-high-res media. Apple is also selling the keyboard and mouse separately, as it has in the past. Already, we've seen some commentary on the internet criticizing Apple for being stingy, but keep in mind that many of the folks buying this might well be businesses that already have keyboards and mice lying around, so they might not actually be missing these accessories as much as you think they are.WRAP-UPI debated even putting the word ""expensive"" in the cons list of that review card you see down there. It's hard to say if the Mac Pro is pricey, per se, given that there's nothing else quite like it. There are plenty of Windows-based workstations, certainly, but none are quite this small or quite this portable (many aren't quite this quiet, either). And if you're a creative professional already hooked into Mac-only apps like Final Cut Pro, this is really your only choice: The new Mac Pro is a serious improvement over the old model in every way, and is likely worth the upgrade. So, while $2,999 (let alone $10,000) is indeed a big investment, it's well worth it for people who live and die by their workstation, and for whom (rendering) time is money.",5,a great update to the old mac pro line,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,hardwareif the mac pro really does look like a trash can as everyone says its much nicer than any rubbish bin ive ever owned starting with the shape which seems to have earned it so much ridicule the mac pro is basically a squat little cylinder with a large circular opening up top where the heat creeps out between that and the glossy gunmetal space gray finish it does indeed look like some sort of futuristic wastepaper basketthen of course you turn the thing around and notice the apple logo power button and a cutout in the anodizedaluminum exposure making it easy to access the various ports not exactly a garbage can that all told the mac pro is a compact little thing standing inches tall and measuring inches in diameter for whatever reason the photography on apples site perhaps it feels smaller and shorter than i imagined it to give you some perspective the pro stands around half as tall as a inch monitor like apples own cinema display and has roughly the same footprint as an office phone so if you have room for a landline you almost certainly have room for the mac pro and if you have enough room for a landline you can probably get away with using the mac pro in other small spaces like a music stage or the corner of a film setspeaking of the sort the machine is light enough at pounds that you could conceivably take it with you to your next shoot left uncovered youll want to handle it gingerly of course but if you keep the original box with the foam inserts you should have no problem carrying it in the crook of your arm in fact that might not be such a bad idea the glossy aluminum finish is also quite the fingerprint magnet much more so than any other apple products weve seen if you do carry this around by hand be prepared to wipe off some smudges now and againswinging back to the ports for a moment these include headphone and mic jacks four usb sockets six thunderbolt connections dual gigabit ethernet ports and an hdmi port as a nice even more futuristic touch the power button glows white briefly when you turn on the machine as do a few other accent lights around the ports the leds even fade as you shut down the computer and flick on again one by one as its booting up additionally youll find a locking switch that keeps the removable aluminum enclosure in place you cant actually power on the machine unless the cover is on one thing you wont find here a memory card slot this makes sense in a way given that pros arent big on sd cards and there are simply too many other formats to accommodate on one small chassis to build in say a cf slot but not one for xqd would have been rather arbitrary indeedinternalssix paragraphs so far and ive only described the removable case slip it off and you get to the heart of the machine a tall threesided board apple is calling the thermal core two of the sides are taken up by the gpus dual graphics cards are standard here whereas the cpu occupies the third ill get to performance and configuration options in a moment but for now suffice to say you can configure this thing with two amd firepro d gpus and gb of video memory amounting to up to seven teraflops of computing power the last mac pro maxed out at teraflops meanwhile there are two ram banks with two slots each located on either side of the cpu board combined these can accommodate up to gb of ddr memory with bandwidth of up to gigabytes per secondwith the exception of the processor everything is userreplaceable the ram the gpus and the solidstate storage i still wouldnt recommend that the average person replace the gpu himself but then again the mac pro isnt exactly for the average consumer in the first placespeaking of thermal performance this is the thermal core after all apple designed a cooling system whereby air is sucked in at the base of the machine and gets pushed out of that large hole in the top rather than use multiple fans apple went with just one tweaking the size shape speed and spacing of the blades in the end the companys engineering team settled on backwardcurved impeller blades which spin at fewer revolutions per minute than on the lastgen mac prothe idea of course is for the blades to effectively cool the system but also to make less noise in the process according to apple the new pro reaches decibels while under load versus db on the last edition and when the machine is idle it simmers down to just db very similar to the lowerpowered mac mini as ill discuss later in the review the machine is indeed as quiet as advertised though that may or may not come at the expense of some warm operating temperaturesperformancethough the unit we have here is very nearly an entrylevel configuration quadcore intel xeon e processor gb of ram gb ssd dual gb amd firepro d gpus i also had the chance to test out a more trickedout version that was an model with an eightcore cpu gb of ram a tb ssd and two firepro d gpus the best graphics apple is offering with the newest version of final cut pro x which has been specifically optimized to take advantage of the mac pros dual gpus i saw the machine play back pictureinpicture k streams simultaneouslyediting is a seamless affair too you can apply a filter to a video and see it go into effect immediately zero rendering time here ditto for previews you can instantly see how an effect will look without having to wait for the machine to catch up last example retiming a fourandahalfminute clip to just a few seconds was also instantaneous i could immediately play back a much shorter version of that same footage im no videographer as you all know but if i were it would be nice not to have to wait while i had a director or client looking over my shoulder asking me to make changes because in my fantasy life as a videographer im always on locationfortunately you dont need an configuration to enjoy that kind of performance even on the more modestly specced machine i was able to preview and apply effects and transitions with zero waiting time as on the higherend model i could play back multiple k streams at once additionally i was able to add effects to clips while playing back my project and could immediately jump to that clip to see the effect in action at one point i went a little overboard and added filters and the footage still ran flawlessly nb theres an option in settings that causes playback to stop as soon as a frame drops but that never happened during my testing not once truth be told i probably could have applied even more than effects but by that time i had conceded defeat and was starting to feel bored with my little gameother stats importing a gb folder of mov files from the desktop took less than two seconds i had barely pressed the start button on my stopwatch and the import was already over when it came time to export exporting that gb project from prores to h took five minutes and seconds as a side note when i timed the export i made sure i wasnt doing anything else in final cut pro since the program is designed to slow background processes if theres something going on in the foreground that said i found that i could play other k clips while exporting a project though at one point i hit a clip that included a k pictureinpicture overlay which caused a brief slowdowni wont dwell too much on benchmark scores here for the simple reason that most tests have not yet been optimized to take advantage of dual gpus as you can see in the above table for instance the numbers are on par with a recent imac even though the realworld performance here is far superior especially in apps like final cut pro x which have been designed to leverage both graphics cards meanwhile our test system ran the cinebench r open gl test at frames per second that too is a good showing but still not as fast as youd expect of a dualgpu machineits a similar story with gaming i ran batman arkham city the game of the year edition but suspect it was using just one of the gpus with resolution set to x details on high and antialiasing at its highest setting x the mac pro managed an average of frames per second with frame rates running the gamut from to fps it wasnt until i dropped the antialiasing and detail levels to medium that i saw rates climb to frames per second with a peak of fps even then that was only a modest improvement in the mac pros defense though gameplay is smooth especially if you disable v sync which caps frame rates the performance just isnt quite as robust as youd expect on a machine this powerfulwithout belaboring the point this brings me to one of my few concerns about the mac pro which is that right now at least most programs wont fully harness its graphics capabilities one of the reasons i spent so much time in final cut pro is that its one of the few programs designed specifically to run well on a new mac pro it reminds me a bit of how retina display macbook pros were initially short on compatible software if that analogy holds true we should see more apps retooled to play nice with the mac pros dualgpu setup just be prepared for some slim pickings if you buy one this weekas for tasks that arent gpuintensive startup consistently took around seconds a moot point if youre one of those people who never shuts down before leaving the office if you do shut down regularly you might find the bootup sequence slightly tedious though youll of course make up for it in rendering time copying a nearly gb file from the downloads folder to the desktop was basically instantaneous most apps launched with virtually zero wait time even final cut pro a fairly heavyduty program was up and running in under three secondsthroughout the mac pro gets a bit warm but its rarely hot and its always quiet for lack

loads with write speeds coming out to mbs to put that in perspective the newest imac managed mbs on the read test and just mbs when it came to write speeds big difference wouldnt you sayin addition to the ssd the thunderbolt ports bring some serious speed of their own thanks to their bandwidth of gbps you can daisychain up to six peripherals per port or for the whole machine or you can connect up

A red dot finder, unlike an optical finder, has 1x magnification, displays a super wide field of view, and keeps the sky right side up and left-to-right correct, matching what you see with your unaided eyes. An LED creates a red dot, superimposed on a viewing screen, so you simply point the Star Pointer to the area or object you wish to observe, look through your eyepiece, and if properly aligned, the area in and around place you pointed the red dot will be centered in the field of view. If you like the idea of having some magnification, try installing both a red dot and optical finder on your telescope. Schmidt-Cassegrain and EdgeHD telescopes have multiple mounting bracket holes so you can get the best of both worlds. Just make sure to align both of them correctly, and youll get the best use out of each of your finders. How to Align the Star Pointer Finderscope The first time you use your finder, you need to align it. This one-time setup procedure should be done during the day. Take the telescope outside and find an easily recognizable object, such as a streetlight, car license plate, or tall tree. The object should be as far away as possible, but at least a quarter mile away. Move the telescope left and right or up and down so that it is roughly pointing at the object. Look through the telescope using your low power eyepiece and move the telescope until the object you chose lies in the center of the view. Once the object is centered in your eyepiece, turn on the red dot. With your head positioned about a foot behind the finder, look through the round lens of the finder and locate the red dot. Without moving the telescope, use the two adjustment knobs located on the side and underneath the finder. One controls the left-right motion of the dot. The other controls the up-down motion of the dot. Adjust both of these until the red dot appears over the same object you are observing in the eyepiece. Your finder is now aligned and should not require realignment unless it is bumped or dropped. You can even take the finder off the telescope and reattach it while preserving alignment.","Celestron 51630 Star Pointer Telescope Finderscope, Black",Celestron,12.89,positive,0.8481,0.8,0.0,positive

So it loses two stars for that.Audio performance-wise I was skeptical about the ""fake"" surround but, hot-damn it works! I've owned ""true"" 5.1 headphones and the differences are subtle. Having real 5.1 drivers in such close proximity to one another really limits the separation of channels. So-much-so that the ""fake"" sounds nearly the same.As for the surround effect, I like the Dolby implementation. It doesn't have that harshness or excessive echo-ness other systems have had. My ears don't get tired at all listening to them. I do find the bass suffers a bit if you boost it. It will clip out at loud volumes. Generally I run my EQs flat and I left the ""fake"" sound channels at all their defaults. Tweaking them seemed to not improve sound at all. Too far in tweaking and it can sound much worse.The included and required app runs well and are simple. It rests in your systray for easy access. It has the ability to detect games and run custom profiles for those of you that want that.The mic is decent and I like the monitoring mode it does. They pump audio from the mic back in to your headphones at a very low level, just above-a-breath so that you can hear yourself speak clearly. The headphones do such a good job muting outside audio you would find yourself shouting rather quickly. So this auto-monitoring is super handy.In conclusion these will do a good job letting your hear bad-guys sneaking up behind you. That is, if they stay on your head.",3,"Good price, and good fake 7.1.

 TotalMount securely mounts Apple's AirPort Extreme to the wall. TotalMount includes integrated cord management so you can wrap the extra cord behind the mount. 


 Discover the Benefits of Mounting AirPort Extreme 
 TotalMount is ideal for many scenarios - 
 (1) Mounting AirPort Extreme safely away from accidental bumps, spills, and tampering 
 (2) Mounting AirPort Extreme near a power outlet for use as a Wi-Fi range extender 
 (3) Decluttering your desk area 


 FAQ 1 -  Is this mount compatible with the AirPort Extreme tower? Answer - No, this mount is only compatible with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th generations of AirPort Extreme (shown in the pictures). 


 FAQ 2 -  How can I tell if I have an AirPort Extreme that will fit in this mount? Answer - If your AirPort Extreme looks like the AirPort Extreme shown in the pictures, then your AirPort Extreme will fit in this mount. Non-compatible AirPort Extremes look very different (like towers or bubbles). 


 FAQ 3 -  How do I know if I have the newest generation or the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th generation of AirPort Extreme? Answer - The newest generation of AirPort Extreme is a narrow tower. The older generations are short and flat (as shown in the pictures for this mount). Another way to tell is that this mount is compatible with AirPort Extremes purchased between January 2007 and May 2013.

Often the USB extension would come disconnected or simply needed to be re-connected to get charging to just initiate. This is no longer an issue thanks to the AYL 6ft cable that is of better quality than the Apple OEM cable.The data transfer speeds this cable are on par with the OEM Apple cable. I've used this cable on PC's and MACs with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 with no issues so far. Transfer speeds are consistent and fast and charging times are fast and consistent as well. Very good cable.

AJX9A4Q19UTJU,B00HLDFUM2,eau,"[0, 0]",0.0,"The Canon VIXIA Mini X is not a traditional camcorder. It uses a fixed focal ultra wide angle (fisheye) lens and there are two settings in the field of view: ultra wide or close-up. There is no zoom or power zoom. It is primarily geared towards video bloggers and musicians but still more than capable of recording family adventures, vacation, parties, etc. The ultra wide field of view may seem like a GoPro type of camcorder but it is not designed for extreme sports shooting, really.The Mini X has a rather unique form factor unlike a traditional camcorder. It has a small, wide flat body with an adjustable 2.7"" touchscreen LCD on top and an adjustable tilt stand at the bottom. The lens has a built-in cover but the exposed LCD can be subject to scratches if stored improperly. I would recommend getting a generic screen protector and cutting it to size in order to protect the LCD screen.The camcorder supports two video recording formats: AVCHD and MP4 - 24Mbps, 17Mbps and 4Mbps (4Mbps for MP4 only). Lossless 2-channel LPCM 48KHz audio is available for 24Mbps AVCHD, which is particular useful for musicians. Dobly Digital 2.0 and AAC-LC are also supported. Imagine Stabilization is achieved electronically. I wish it was done optically but the end result is still very good. Photo taking is equivalent to a 12 MP camera.The Mini X has lots of professional features not found in consumer camcorders, such as interval/time-lapse recording and slow/fast motion (no sound though), and video snapshot. The interval recording is fun. It allows me to program the camcorder to record half a second of video or photo at a user specified interval. For long recording time, you will need to use the supplied ac adapter to power the camcorder.Video quality is good in daylight shooting. It's on par with most consumer camcorders. However, low light performance is comparatively poor (noisy). My Sony RX100 camera can do a much better job of shooting in low light conditions. Audio quality is top notch and far exceeds that of most consumer camcorders. I recorded live musical performance using LPCM and the result is extremely satisfying. Vocal is clear and instruments are very musical in the recording. External mic with 3.5mm plug can be connected to the Mini X directly if you have an external mic to get close to the performance.Video streaming is supported but via Wi-Fi only. You can use the camcorder as a security camera with your mobile devices and control/view it remotely. Canon even has a pan cradle for it (sold separately) that allows remote control panning.One thing I don't like about this camcorder is that the manual controls. I can't find a way to do manual focus. Also, you don't always having independent control over ISO, aperture, shutter speed and white balance. For example, manually adjusting the white balance would render the other controls automatic.The VIXIA Mini X is a special camcorder optimized for video blogging and musicians. It is truly a pocket sized camcorder that has great video quality and very high audio quality. It doesn't have a zoom but has many features that are only found in professional camcorders.

And a centered 1920 x 1080 image is also available to record videos (1920 x 1440 for stills) with a more classic look with Close-up mode, which shoots at 35.0mm for videos and 32.1mm for photos (35mm equivalent).|The VIXIA mini X incorporates the latest and most advanced Canon HD Image Processor, the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor. A significant upgrade on several fronts, the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor features dramatically increased processing power and captures more light, for brighter, noise-free images even in dark scenes.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder features the Canon HS SYSTEM – a powerful combination of the Canon DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor and a 12.8 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor – that offers dramatically increased processing power and the ability to operate in lower light levels. By capturing more light, the camera produces brighter, noise-free images even during dark scenes, extending your ability to create images with spectacular depth and detail. The Canon HS SYSTEM also provides excellent tracking performance even with low light levels, to achieve outstanding still-image quality with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlights and shadow areas. An Auto Dynamic Range control and new gamma curve settings prevent over- and under-exposure, even when capturing high-contrast images. The end result is clearer HD videos and still images with reduced noise and motion blur in a variety of shooting situations.|The versatile VIXIA mini X camcorder offers a choice of two Full HD video recording formats to convenient SD-format memory cards. AVCHD secures enhanced images at 1920x1080 resolution and 60i frame rate, while MP4 format is available in either 1920x1080 or 1280x720 resolutions at 30p or 24p frame rates; MP4 640x360 is also possible at 4 Mbps for live-streaming applications. Time code data is provided on AVCHD recordings for compatibility for non-linear editing systems. MP4-format media is also conveniently available via internal transcoding of high-resolution AVCHD recordings, for quick and easy uploads to blogs and social networking websites.|The VIXIA mini X records digital video files on readily-available SD, SDHC or SDXC media for high-capacity storage and ultra-fast data transfer speeds to external editors and streaming services. The camcorder also captures high-quality images with up to 12.0 Megapixels of resolution.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder not only captures great video, but outstanding audio quality as well, thanks to its built-in, high-quality stereo microphone. The use of 16-bit Linear PCM audio* format at a CD-quality sampling rate of 48 kHz – rather than an MPEG or similar compression scheme that can diminish sonic quality – adds an extra dimension to any video recording, by capturing full-fidelity, pristine sound with depth and realistic nuances.|* Only supported in AVCHD/24 Mbps recording mode|Pristine audio recordings from a camcorder require a precision, low-noise microphone. The VIXIA mini X camcorder's high-quality, large-diameter stereo microphone captures enhanced, immersive sound that adds a heightened sense of stereo depth that further draws viewers into a video scene. A separate audio-level control ensures distortion-free recordings with no overload. The large 10mm microphone element is 2.5-times larger than the VIXIA mini with improved sensitivity. A higher signal-to-noise performance results in ultra-low noise recordings, while a two-layer sponge and cloth mesh windshield further reduces unwanted air-borne noise. The combination results in clearer, transparent recordings from low to high frequencies with low electrical noise.|Audio Scene Select on the VIXIA mini X lets you select optimized recording parameters for specific types of shoots, including newly added Meeting, Festival and Custom Setting modes. Meeting is the best choice for group recordings with multiple participants around the camcorder for a greater sense of ambiance. Festival is best for outdoor musical events to capture the sound of performers around the camera with a good stereo balance, while Custom settings offers individual adjustments of Directivity, Frequency Characteristics, Microphone Level, Wind Screen, Mic Attenuator, Audio Limiter and Audio Compressor.|Other modes comprise: Standard, which is best for weddings and similar events, with versatile, well-balanced settings for many occasions; Music for indoor performances to capture audio around the camera with emphasized contrast; Forest and Birds for natural environments to produce clear, expansive recordings of birdsong and other on-location shoots; Speech, to capture a specific individual, with recording focused in a single direction; and Noise Suppression, which has been optimized for in-vehicle recording to reduce road or wind noise.|A choice of Wide and Close-up shooting modes provides additional versatility. Wide mode records video with an expansive 150-degree angle of view for AVCHD and 160 degrees for MP4, capturing the whole scene. Additionally, the VIXIA mini X camcorder offers a useful Close-up Mode that uses the center of the video image where there is less peripheral distortion. Thanks to the camera's high-resolution sensor, even for close-up shots you are assured Full HD recording without image interpolation. An advanced electronic image stabilization system (EIS) helps ensure that images remain crisp during close-ups, even while the hand-held camera is moving. The EIS function is particularly useful for ENG-style interviews, dashboard-mount shoots and other productions where the camcorder is either handheld, or undergoes sideways or up-and-down motion.|During AVCHD-format recordings, Close-up mode offers an approximately 51-degree angle of view, while MP4-format videos offer an approximately 64-degree view; the narrower focus for AVCHD results from slight differences in image resolution. Still images offer an approximately 78-degree view in Close-up mode.|For integration within professional-level shoots, both time code and digital-format video output are necessary. The VIXIA mini X camcorder provides embedded time code for AVCHD-format recordings, which enables frame-accurate editing on professional NLE systems as well as the accurate synchronization of recordings from the VIXIA mini X with other video and audio recorders. User-selectable time code formats include NTSC 60i/30P or NTSC 24P, in either continuous Rec Run or Non Drop Frame configurations. In contrast, MP4 recording includes elapsed times of scenes in hours, minutes and seconds, plus remaining time.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's uncompressed HDMI output delivers a digital video signal with embedded two-channel audio in most camcorder and playback modes for live monitoring during shoots on a high-resolution 1080 monitor or large-screen TV. In this way you can check how shots with multiple participants – including band recordings – are being composed, or how a particular scene looks when shooting a wedding or conference event.|In addition to using the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in stereo microphone, external microphones can be connected to the camcorder for extra creative options or enhanced fidelity. A separate Mic Level control adjusts recording levels; you can also listen to recordings as they are being made using external headphones. For enhanced flexibility, other recording settings are available within Custom Audio Scene settings, including Wind Screen, Directionality, Attenuator and Frequency Characteristics (for the built-in mic), Low Cut, plus an Audio Limiter and Audio Compressor, which are particularly useful while recording live performances to even out dramatic differences in loudness. Mixed recording is also possible using an external microphone in conjunction with the camcorder's built-in mic.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in Wi-Fi® allows you to easily share MP4 video recordings and still images over the Internet via social networking sites such as YouTube™ and Facebook® using the CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# online photo storage service, or conveniently transfer your files to a home or office PC. Uploads can be made virtually anywhere using a familiar iOS® device and the free Canon Movie Uploader app*. HD video can also be shared with colleagues and co-workers whenever and wherever you need. The VIXIA mini X can be connected via Wi-Fi® using compatible home or office wireless networks, wireless hotspots and iOS-compatible mobile phones and tablets using the Movie Uploader app.|# One-time registration is required on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY online photo album. * This software enables you to upload images to social network sites.

Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software. Compatible with iOS version 5/6/7 or later for select devices. AVCHD recordings are not supported for this function.|The Live Streaming function enabled by the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in Wi-Fi® allows you to receive the live video and sound that your camcorder is recording from a remote location on your iOS® or Android™ device using the free Canon CameraAccess plus app†. The Canon CameraAccess plus app supports live streaming of video and remote control of key camcorder parameters, including record start/stop and zoom, from a compatible smart device; it can also integrate key system information such as battery life. The app can monitor live video from a smartphone or tablet, and also confirm that videos have been successfully recorded on a remotely located camcorder. In this way, you can review video files at home, or share media with colleagues working on a cooperative project in another remote location via peer-to-peer connections.|For remote surveillance applications, the camcorder can also be installed on an optional Canon Camera Pan Table CT-V1 that enables manual vertical tilt and horizontal panning across a 200-degree angle. Horizontal panning can be controlled via Wi-Fi® using a smartphone or tablet† with the CameraAccess plus app. Used with the VIXIA mini X camcorder's ultra wide-angle lens mode, which offers a wide angle of view, such a combination provides a nearly complete circular view.|† Compatible with iOS version 5/6/7 or later or Android version 2.3/4.0/4.1/4.2 or later for select devices. Operations not guaranteed with all versions of the supported OS.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's 2.7-inch LCD monitor lets you see every nuance of a scene, and quickly switch between video and still-image mode with fast, easy-to-use intuitive controls. A familiar touch panel lets you simply tap and swipe the screen in the same way as you might use a tablet or smartphone. The big LCD makes it easy to switch from shooting video to capturing still images from various angles – low, high and even inverted – with fast toggling between Wide and Close-up modes at the tap of a finger. You can easily scroll through captured images, tap through simple menu options, and then quickly share projects with friends and colleagues, with a fast and intuitive user interface designed to accommodate the needs of contemporary video and photo shoots.|A built-in, adjustable stand and tripod socket enable easy positioning of the VIXIA mini X camcorder, making it possible to shoot scenes hands-free, including presentations in which you are starring. The combination of a large, variable-angle LCD screen that flips on parallel hinges, and a built-in stand that adjusts to various positions, offer virtually limitless shooting options. You can shoot low-angle with the screen fully closed, and high-angle or straight on with the screen in the rear position. You can also shoot in multiple directions with the camera inverted; the camera automatically rotates the image for playback. Hands-free videos have never been easier. Simply place the screen in the front position and position the sturdy stand at the required angle. A tripod socket helps ensure steady recordings.|The VIXIA mini X makes it easy to add interest and excitement to your MP4 video recordings using classic special effects. You can now control the pace and rhythm of office presentations, for example, with a choice of Slow Motion and Fast Motion sequences. Slow Motion is available at ½- and ¼-times play speed, for highlighting a manufacturing process, reviewing a complex maneuver or simply adding dramatic effects. Fast Motion at 2x and 4x play speeds is perfect for showing off creative talents in makeup, painting, woodworking and more, or accelerating various timelines.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's Interval Recording mode lets you see slow-changing movements over time. The camcorder records JPEG still images or half-second MP4 video clips at pre-determined intervals – 5, 10 or 30 seconds; 1 or 10 minutes – with playback in flip-book style. Perfect for recording plant growth, cloud movement, tidal changes, light effects from dawn to sunset and much more, this mode is also useful for adding a multimedia element to an office presentation or research project.|The VIXIA mini X camcorder's newly designed NB-12L battery provides 2.5-times the capacity as previous models, for extended record times and additional still images from a single charge. You can now accommodate continuous video recordings of long meetings or music performances up to 150 minutes long. A convenient rear-panel layout and battery cover lets you swap with internal-charging batteries without removing the camcorder from its tripod.|A new Special Scene Mode, In The Car, brings to the VIXIA mini X an optimized exposure setting for a certain type of difficult-to-get-right video shoot. In The Car mode corrects exposure settings for passengers inside vehicles that tend to be backlit and, as a result, normally are shot too brightly; instead, the camcorder's settings are adjusted to be correct for dark areas so that areas inside the car will not be lost in the shadows.|Designed to be ultra-portable and ready to shoot in an instant, the VIXIA mini X camcorder's built-in lens shutter automatically opens when you turn it on, so that there is no need to remove and then keep track of a separate cap when the action begins. Simply power on the camera and the lens shutter slides open; power off and it slides shut, protecting the valuable Canon lens from dirt, dust and scratches.|Particularly useful for practicing office presentations or checking your golf swing, Mirror Image Recording/Playback mode flips the image horizontally to let you view a scene in real time as you watch a recording. Any dance student will immediately understand how much easier it is to follow and learn from a mirror image, but the feature is also useful for other kinds of applications, including rehearsing an office presentation or for an interview, perfecting a golf swing, following an intricate fitness routine and more – wherever you like and at your own pace. A Repeat Playback function lets you put a single file on a continuous loop for uninterrupted practice sessions.|Smart AUTO streamlines the recording of high-impact videos by intelligently selecting the best settings from 23 predefined groupings, in addition to the Sports, Snow, Beach, Night, Food and Fashion, Macro, and new In The Car Scene modes.

When removing the TPU sleeve, I found it really helpful to make sure that the notches for power, headphones and the side switch are “open” – easier to peel away the sleeve.2. Before placing your iPad onto the internal hard case, you can adjust the leather strap. Make sure that the both sides of the strap are secure under the pins. It may be worth doing a test tug with your hand through the strap to check that the strap is secure.3. When installing the top part of the internal hard case, make sure that all tabs/clips are in place.4. When putting the TPU sleeve back on, I find it easier to start at the bottom, sliding my iPad into place where the power button is. Work your way around the sides, then the top. Make sure that the sleeve is secure over the internal hard case.Here are the top features of the Gladius Air:1. Rugged protection: Although the case adds some weight to the tablet but I’ll take that for peace of mind that my tablet is protected2. Rotation: I love that the tablet can rotate. I prefer to read ebooks in portrait mode, and watch video/surf the internet in landscape mode.3. Hand strap: The inclusion of the hand strap is a great idea. It comes in handy when I’m watching videos or when I’m trying to show something off my tablet to someone else.I give this case 4 stars because of the leather strap. The holes are too big for the pins to keep the strap secure at all times. Once stretched when in use, the holes even expand (see photo). It’s not too much of a problem when in use, but as soon as you remove your hand from the strap, there is a possibility that the hole will now be too big for the pins, thus “releasing” the strap from the pins. I’m thinking that in the meantime, I will have to secure each side of the strap to each other using some nylon string.",4,Great rugged case for the iPad Air but could be better,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,gladius air reviewto get started here are some helpful hints for installation when removing the tpu sleeve i found it really helpful to make sure that the notches for power headphones and the side switch are open easier to peel away the sleeve before placing your ipad onto the internal hard case you can adjust the leather strap make sure that the both sides of the strap are secure under the pins it may be worth doing a test tug with your hand through the strap to check that the strap is secure when installing the top part of the internal hard case make sure that all tabsclips are in place when putting the tpu sleeve back on i find it easier to start at the bottom sliding my ipad into place where the power button is work your way around the sides then the top make sure that the sleeve is secure over the internal hard casehere are the top features of the gladius air rugged protection although the case adds some weight to the tablet but ill take that for peace of mind that my tablet is protected rotation i love that the tablet can rotate i prefer to read ebooks in portrait mode and watch videosurf the internet in landscape mode hand strap the inclusion of the hand strap is a great idea it comes in handy when im watching videos or when im trying to show something off my tablet to someone elsei give this case stars because of the leather strap the holes are too big for the pins to keep the strap secure at all times once stretched when in use the holes even expand see photo its not too much of a problem when in use but as soon as you remove your hand from the strap there is a possibility that the hole will now be too big for the pins thus releasing the strap from the pins im thinking that in the meantime i will have to secure each side of the strap to each other using some nylon string,gladius air reviewto get started here some helpful hints installation when removing tpu sleeve found really helpful make sure notches power headphones side switch open easier peel away sleeve placing ipad onto internal hard case can adjust leather strap make sure both sides strap secure pins may worth test tug hand strap check strap secure when installing top part internal hard case make sure all tabsclips place when putting tpu sleeve back find easier start bottom sliding ipad place where power button work way around sides top make sure sleeve secure internal hard casehere top features gladius air rugged protection although case adds some weight tablet ill take peace mind tablet protected rotation love tablet can rotate prefer read ebooks portrait mode watch videosurf internet landscape mode hand strap inclusion hand strap great idea comes handy when im watching videos when im trying show something tablet someone elsei give case stars leather strap holes too big pins keep strap secure all times stretched when use holes even expand see photo not too much problem when use soon remove hand strap there possibility hole will now too big pins thus releasing strap pins im thinking meantime will secure each side strap each other using some nylon string,21-Jul-14,1937,351,"Electronics|Computers & Accessories|Tablet Accessories|Bags, Cases & Sleeves|Cases",Computers,No description available,"NewTrent iPad Case 2018/2017, Heavy Duty Gladius Full-body Rugged Protective Case with Built-in Screen Protector & Dual Layer Design for Apple iPad 9.7 inch 2017/2018",New Trent,27.95,positive,0.9958,0.2112903225806452,0.2,positive

Ample storage space, full electronics capacity and unique accessory pockets are inconspicuous beneath the streamlined, tapered construction and subtle tone-on-tone design.     Materials|High quality materials used throughout the construction of this backpack allow it to withstand the wear and tear of your daily routine. The body of the backpack consists of sturdy nylon and high density twill for superior abrasion resistance. Treated with an elastic-polyurethane, the exterior is also water-resistant so you don’t have to worry if you get caught in that light rain shower. The pockets are lined with soft, quiet polyester creating an easy glide when you need to get items in and out of the backpack.

The rear compartment of the backpack will accommodate laptops with up to a 17.3'' screen and includes an integrated, padded pocket sized to fit an iPad® or tablet (encased or not). The tablet pocket is elevated against the front of the compartment creating optimal weight distribution and comfort. An oversized zipper allows smooth and easy access to these electronics.|The multi-functional compression straps are designed to accommodate the constant changes in the load one is carrying, the climate one is departing from or arriving to, and the places where one is waiting in line. Two triangular flaps reach from the front to buckle to an adjustable strap that expands or minimizes the size of your backpack. In addition to regulating the bulk of the bag, the broad flaps provide a space for you to slide a rolled-up light rain jacket or sweater, keeping your layers readily available for temperature or weather changes. If you feel you need more security, pull both zippers on each of the storage compartments to one side, where they are hidden under the flap.|Two storage compartments were developed to handle whatever your travel needs are or your day holds. The larger middle compartment has a cavernous area for a change of clothes or bulkier items along with a slim file pocket to prevent magazines and documents from bending or tearing.

This makes life a bit difficult when you want music in there. Well, thank you MOCREO for creating the Waterproof Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (mouthful!).I tested this with my iPhone 5S. Pairing via Bluetooth was a simple process, taking just a few seconds. After that, I immediately played some music from my iPhone, and was quite surprised at the sound this little box can put out. Given that it's ""waterproof,"" I figured there would be some muffled or distorted audio, but there wasn't. The sound is a little... low-end, but it's definitely good enough for a bathroom or small outside area background speaker.Bass is pretty tightly controlled, and while the unit itself you can feel vibrating if you put your hand on it, there's no indication of the vibration carried through to the actual audio you hear. Good stuff.The giant + and - on the top of the unit changes the track with a quick press, and changes volume on a long press.One funny thing is the, ""Waiting for connection,"" voice is spoken in rather broken English, the next voice, ""Bluetooth Connected,"" is spoken in American English, and then the ""Power off"" voice is spoken - ""Ower off,"" because the ""P"" got cut off. Oops! Definitely a little rough around edges.Overall, though, this is a decent speaker if you need the waterproof ability it offers. While I'd hesitate to dunk it in the sink, it's more than happy sitting on your steamy bathroom counter, or getting splashed by the sink.4 stars out of 5.

I can keep my iPod in my pocket while I work, and if I get the speaker wet while sprinkling, it's no big deal.But the waterproof quality really isn't the thing that sells me on this.  I like the sound quality very much.  I'm not a high tech audiophile, I just want something that plays music that's not distorted, and that has a reasonable dynamic range.  The MOCREO speaker does just that.  Also, setup is really simple.  You turn it on, pair it with a Bluetooth device and you're good to go.  If the pairing doesn't take place in a minute or two, the speaker powers off.  The charge lasts for hours.  I've been playing for the last three days on one charge.  A full charge takes a couple of hours, and it can be charged with a stand-alone USB charger.The only problem I had with pairing was on my laptop, using a Bluetooth dongle, but it wasn't the speaker's fault, and I can use an Aux In cord to listen to music via my laptop so it's all good.  I'm listening to Spotify right now, and it makes me very happy.If you're looking for a good, solid Bluetooth speaker, and you don't care that it doesn't pound out bass that sounds like the hounds of Hell are coming to get you, this is a good, reasonably priced option.",5,Love this speaker!,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,i am so impressed with this speaker i wanted something to take out to the garden with me and this waterproof speaker is perfect i can keep my ipod in my pocket while i work and if i get the speaker wet while sprinkling its no big dealbut the waterproof quality really isnt the thing that sells me on this i like the sound quality very much im not a high tech audiophile i just want something that plays music thats not distorted and that has a reasonable dynamic range the mocreo speaker does just that also setup is really simple you turn it on pair it with a bluetooth device and youre good to go if the pairing doesnt take place in a minute or two the speaker powers off the charge lasts for hours ive been playing for the last three days on one charge a full charge takes a couple of hours and it can be charged with a standalone usb chargerthe only problem i had with pairing was on my laptop using a bluetooth dongle but it wasnt the speakers fault and i can use an aux in cord to listen to music via my laptop so its all good im listening to spotify right now and it makes me very happyif youre looking for a good solid bluetooth speaker and you dont care that it doesnt pound out bass that sounds like the hounds of hell are coming to get you this is a good reasonably priced option,so impressed speaker wanted something take garden waterproof speaker perfect can keep ipod pocket work get speaker wet sprinkling no big dealbut waterproof quality really isnt thing sells like sound quality very much im not high tech audiophile just want something plays music thats not distorted reasonable dynamic range mocreo speaker just also setup really simple turn pair bluetooth device youre good go pairing doesnt take place minute two speaker powers charge lasts hours ive playing last three days one charge full charge takes couple hours can charged standalone usb chargerthe only problem pairing laptop using bluetooth dongle wasnt speakers fault can use aux cord listen music via laptop so all good im listening spotify right now makes very happyif youre looking good solid bluetooth speaker dont care doesnt pound bass sounds like hounds hell coming get good reasonably priced option,21-Jul-14,1350,253,Electronics|Portable Audio & Video|Portable Speakers & Docks|Portable Bluetooth Speakers,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Main features: - 2 stereo speakers deliver superior bass performance for those low tones that help ensure rich, high-quality sound. - Bathing and showering will never be boring ever again!IP54 Waterproof makes you share your music and streaming audio when shower - You can also answer your calls from the comfort of your bath/shower - Control all functions on the speaker: Skip, Play, or Volume Control - Automatically Pairs your device with the speaker when in range of speaker - Compatible with iphone/Touch4/Kindle fire/iPod/Samsung Galaxy S3/S4/S5 and other external Bluetooth Devices - Magical sound amplification function for mobile phone or other Bluetooth enable devices - Play music wireless, support TF card - Best gift idea.Indoor and outdoors use|Remind: This Speaker is designed for use in wet locations BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE IMMERSED INTO WATER|Specifications: - Brand: MOCREO - Model NO.: MOSOUND Bar - BluetoothV2.1+EDR(A2DP - Transmition range: up to 30ft(10M) - Input power: 3.5Wx2 - USB charging voltage: DC5V - Built in Power: Li-ion Battery 3.7V/2600mAh - Frequency range: 120Hz-18KHz  - Battery life: 6Hours - Waterproof grade: IPx5 - TF card: Support - Matterial: Silcon - Speaker dimension: 7.12(L)x2.76(W)x2.54(H)inch (181x70x64.5mm)|Packing list: - 1 x Bluetooth speaker - 1 x USB cable - 1 x 3.5mm Audio cable - 1 x User manual","MOCREO Bluetooth Speaker Portable, IPx5 Water-resistant Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker - MOSOUND Bar (White)",MOCREO,,positive,0.9093,0.2854658385093168,0.2,positive

A19NP8YYADOOSF,B00JF0D7RE,N. Krumpe,"[0, 1]",0.0,"I received one of these to test and review.  The size and rugged feel impressed me off the bat.  For a waterproof speaker intended for outdoor use, this is a good choice.  There are a lot of features for the price.  Some notes:** Audio Quality **I use this primarily for streaming Spotify music.  I tried it on a Google Nexus 7 and on an iPhone 4S.  On both, the music quality was decent.  Not great.  Just decent.  From the moment the speaker is turned on, there is a quiet hiss that doesn't go away when the music is playing, but becomes much less noticeable when music plays a little louder.  It's not enough to bother me, but I do notice it.  For a small get-together outdoors, this provides decent audio quality.** Connectivity **When I first turned the speaker on, a friendly voice from the speaker said it was ""ready to connect"".  I had absolutely no trouble connecting to my iPhone or Nexus 7.  There were times I used it with the Nexus 7 when the audio would drop out for a second or so.  It immediately came back each time. I'm not sure what the cause was.  The Nexus and the speaker were just a couple inches from each other.  Is this a connectivity issue?** Using it for phone calls **When using this to answer phone calls, I found that I need to stand quite close to the speaker when talking.  When I stand on one side of my kitchen, with the speaker on the other side, the caller has trouble hearing me when I speak in a normal conversational tone.  I do like the convenience of being able to handle calls with this speaker, but I just have to get used to being right next to it.** Functionality **I like the oversized buttons on the top.  It's interesting that the same buttons are used both for volume control and for skipping songs.  This took some getting used to.  A couple times, when I wanted to increase the volume, I accidentally pressed the big ""+"" button a few times to increase the volume a few notches.  But that's not how the button works...instead of increasing the volume, it skipped 3 tracks ahead on my Spotify playlist.  The solution?  Hold down the big ""+"" button when I want to change the volume.Note also that MOCREO says this comes with ""TF card"" support.  This is equivalent to ""Micro SD"" support.  There is a card slot which, I suppose, could be used if you had a card full of songs.  Then, you could listen to music without needing to connect to a separate device.All in all, for the price, this is a good speaker.  If it cost much more, I would expect a bit more in terms of audio quality.  But it is easy to recommend if you are looking for an outdoor speaker at a reasonable price.",4,Decent quality for the price.

AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00JGGUZRC,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[0, 0]",0.0,"The Samsung is very similar to the Eachine X-Power Serie X2 and contains a whopping 10,400mAh, which is a good chunk of power - enough to charge most Smartphone's about five times and an iPad at least twice (fully). 10,000 mAh is really the minimum you want in a power bank. Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. The small hand-size (approximately 5.5"" X 2.5"" X 1"") is great for packing.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 8.6 ounces. It also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful, but using this light will eat up your battery power quickly.  It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device.This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/1.0A charge for most other devices.  In between these ports is the Micro-USB port for charging - the power cord is included along with extra adapters for other electronic devices.  These are all on the narrower side.  The emergency light is on the top narrow edge of the unit.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%). That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left. I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let's say, four LED lights that represent 25% each. With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.  It's a nice bright blue on the white background on the wide side of the unit with an On/Off button next to it.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. I like this power bank more than most I own simply for its small size and big power.

A2LU109B1DCIU9,B00AQU2V2Y,Jacob,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I tried these with a pair of Shure SE846 IEMs.  For those who have comfort issues with stock foam tips and still prefer foam over silicone, these may be a significant improvement.  If you don't have comfort issues with the stock tips, then don't bother.These foam tips are initially much less pliable than the stock Shure foam tips.  However, once warmed up, the foam becomes very soft and very pliable, much more than the stock tips.  Prior to warming up, they're easier to insert into your ear because they expand much less rapidly, giving you more time to position them correctly once you compress them.Supposedly, the only difference between the Comfort PLUS and the Isolation PLUS is the shape of the tip.  The Comfort PLUS are rounder, whereas the Isolation PLUS have the traditional cylindrical shape you see with the stock Shure tips.  The round shape may be more comfortable for some, but I found that the round shape didn't seal as well.  This may force some to try a size up, which can defeat the purpose of the more comfortable round shape.Some have complained that Comply tips change the frequency response or muffle the sound, but I didn't notice any difference.  I do, however, always compress the top of the foam to the level of the barrel so that the top edge of the foam doesn't block the barrel when inserted.These do have the built-in wax guard, but Shure has recently begun placing a wax guard in their stock foam tips as well.These are a decent product for those who are bothered by the stock tips, but there is little to be gained for others.",3,Only worth it if the stock foam tips bother you.,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,i tried these with a pair of shure se iems for those who have comfort issues with stock foam tips and still prefer foam over silicone these may be a significant improvement if you dont have comfort issues with the stock tips then dont botherthese foam tips are initially much less pliable than the stock shure foam tips however once warmed up the foam becomes very soft and very pliable much more than the stock tips prior to warming up theyre easier to insert into your ear because they expand much less rapidly giving you more time to position them correctly once you compress themsupposedly the only difference between the comfort plus and the isolation plus is the shape of the tip the comfort plus are rounder whereas the isolation plus have the traditional cylindrical shape you see with the stock shure tips the round shape may be more comfortable for some but i found that the round shape didnt seal as well this may force some to try a size up which can defeat the purpose of the more comfortable round shapesome have complained that comply tips change the frequency response or muffle the sound but i didnt notice any difference i do however always compress the top of the foam to the level of the barrel so that the top edge of the foam doesnt block the barrel when insertedthese do have the builtin wax guard but shure has recently begun placing a wax guard in their stock foam tips as wellthese are a decent product for those who are bothered by the stock tips but there is little to be gained for others,tried pair shure se iems comfort issues stock foam tips still prefer foam silicone may significant improvement dont comfort issues stock tips dont botherthese foam tips initially much less pliable than stock shure foam tips however warmed foam becomes very soft very pliable much more than stock tips prior warming theyre easier insert ear expand much less rapidly giving more time position correctly compress themsupposedly only difference comfort plus isolation plus shape tip comfort plus rounder whereas isolation plus traditional cylindrical shape see stock shure tips round shape may more comfortable some found round shape didnt seal well may force some try size can defeat purpose more comfortable round shapesome complained comply tips change frequency response muffle sound didnt notice any difference however always compress top foam level barrel so top edge foam doesnt block barrel when insertedthese builtin wax guard shure recently begun placing wax guard stock foam tips wellthese decent product bothered stock tips there little gained others,21-Jul-14,1565,276,Uncategorized,Uncategorized,No description available,Untitled,Unknown Brand,,positive,0.9581,0.15211805555555555,0.2,positive

They're not made for the headphones, and are not suggested by Comply- but they are able to be coaxed over the slightly larger diameter holes.These tips provide isolation for those headphones, allowing you to listen at lower volumes in louder environments.  No longer are the days of needing to crank up the discman/iPod to hear it over the mower.The consistency of the foam is synonymous with 'weak marshmallow'.  You have to roll it between your fingers, pull your ear up, insert the headphone into your ear, and hold it there for about 1/2 a minute.  If you're attempting to readjust them while running/exercising - this becomes horribly cumbersome.  I didn't have a poor fit or migration before I started my last run, but I did want to see what I was in store for if I had to pull one out due to a bad feeling/paying more attention/someone trying to talk to me.  I've probably logged 5 hours of active time with these tips since receiving them mid last week, and I will be looking towards purchasing replacements for my replacements when I finally decide on a size.Why 4 stars?

Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. The small hand-size (approximately 5.5"" X 2.5"" X 1"") is great for packing.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 8.6 ounces. It also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful, but using this light will eat up your battery power quickly.  It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device.  The light is on the upper narrow end of the unit.This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/1.0A charge for most other devices.  These are on the narrow end of the unit.  On the reverse end near the emergency light is the micro-USB port for charging the battery - the power cord is included along with extra adapters for other electronic devices.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%). That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left. I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let's say, four LED lights that represent 25% each. With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.  It's a nice bright blue on the white background on the wide side of the unit.  There is an On/Off button next to the Blue LED light.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. I like this power bank more than most I own simply for its small size and big power.

They warn you of this, but it's still a serious issue.I stopped using the volume knob on it initially because it would so easily set off the ringing noise. But I got better at it and learned to ""ninja"" the volume, always careful to release my grip gently versus drag my fingers over the ridges.More serious, is the occasional BUZZ noise I get. This is distinctly different from the microphonic ringing in that it doesn't vary up and down, and it never goes away. Usually only in the left channel. I've found that turning the amp off and on again can fix it. Doesn't happen too often.Other than THAT, it's amazing sound for the price. The Vali/Modi pairing is very similar to the O2/ODAC pairing (which, from what I can find, is somewhat more expensive). If there is a ""tubiness"", I can't tell -- mostly because any direct comparisons can't be done because of the microphonics (unplugging and replugging headphones sets it off tremendously).BUT... $220 (or... $240 on amazon) is an excellent price for the sound quality.

A2RU3I9HV8SQNO,B00HF8A2SA,Nicholas O.,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I bought this to replace a 2007 Western Digital 120GB Scorpio Black on my Lenovo Thinkpad X61.First, I popped this into the Ultrabay, launched Macrium Reflect Free Edition (http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx) to begin the cloning process of my Windows 7 Professional 64bit install.  Not sure how long it took since I did not sit there watching but was fairly quick.  Once completed successfully (in just ONE attempt), I then removed the overdue WD HDD and installed the new Transcend SSD340 in it's place.  Powered on to boot the X61 and it booted up fine, free of errors.  I posted a short video comparing the HDD vs. SSD boot times here: http://youtu.be/tgb0PtOqbIcMight not be the fastest of SSDs out there (I have an OCZ Vertex 4 on a desktop running Windows Professional 8.1 64bit).  On older computers/laptops, it will still provide a massive boost in boot/load/reaction times.  The SSD340 is rated at SATA III (6Gb/s).  My Lenovo X61 is software-coded by the manufacturer to run at SATA1.5 max.  Meaning in current state, this is as fast as the X61 will go (through no fault of Transcend).  I am pretty sure the fastest SSD out there at premium prices will make no difference in performance here.Given the current price for this item and older machines often do not support more than SATA II (3Gb/s), the Transcend SSD340 SATA III (6Gb/s) is more than competent/sufficient for a new lease of life.

ATYUQROTHLNYV,B00JP12170,Laurel,"[0, 0]",0.0,"I love the ""Paper"" app, and have used a generic stylus with it many times. I was so excited when FiftyThree announced this product, and even more thrilled when I got to test one for review.It's very elegant looking and feels great to use. Great weight, great texture, looks beautiful. It links to the iPad through bluetooth, and there's a battery module inside that you charge via USB. In the package you get a replacement tip and eraser, and when you use this product you get all the in-app purchase add-ons available with Paper.In order to turn it on or off, you press the tip to a specific circle in the app. This activates the bluetooth link.Overall, when it worked right, it was great. But it was a little erratic in sensing the difference between the tip, my finger, and the eraser. This isn't a huge problem, because the undo function in Paper is very easy, but still, it was distracting and made the experience less pleasant than ideal. I am not much of an artist, though--I use Paper mostly to practice writing kanji, and occasionally doodle.Still, I love Pencil, and if you like the app and your iPad, this is one of the few add-ons that is equally elegant.

I get clear channels OTA so i am lucky not to have to pay Comcast or UVERSE or something for cable and can get great internet from Monkey Brains.  I wanted the DVR and guide capabilities so I got the Roamio Basic.The machine works (though the first one was defective).  Tivo customer service was great in finding the problem.  Amazon Prime was great in returning/replacing the product.The user interface is pretty good though it seems less good than the Tivo interface I remember from when Directv had Tivo 15 years ago.  on the other hand, my memory might be inflating the cosmicness of the old interface.Services for streaming on the internet are weak with Amazon being the best example of one where false advertising is a kind way of describing the problem.  Amazon Instant is supported (pay, download, not streaming) while Amazon Prime (already paid, streaming) is not.  Hulu Plus is supported but free Hulu is just the adverts... not the same free stuff you can watch on the internet.Youtube actually does stream so we know streaming is technically possible with this machine.  BTW, Youtube lets you cast from your computer, tablet or phone to the screen plugged into the Tivo (this is like Chromecast but is not called Chromecast).  Nice!You cannot browse the web to find a site with streaming built in (18footerstv.com, comedycentral, etc)... if you want to catch John Oliver you have to wait until they come up on elsewhere.So, the machine lets you time offset record/watch live TV (OTA, and with a cable card if you have cable) but it does not substitute for a good streaming machine.The $14.99 a month for the guide is too high... but the main question is whether it continues to be of value as it learns what we actually record and watch on the regular tv.  We will go for 6 months to see whether we end up watching everything online or if there is any value at all in watching/recording OTA shows.  Our viewing habits are not high volume and we don't have to see HBO or Netflix shows the minute they come out.Pro:Customer support was goodvideo quality is very goodbasic guide is good for OTAYoutube casting built inCon:Amazon Prime is missingAnother monthly feeregular hulu missingRequires another streaming box (ROKU, sony Blu Ray players, chromecast, etc)",3,"Roamio Basic OTA is good quality, service too expensive, Amazon Prime not supported (bad advertising from Amazon)",1405900800,"07 21, 2014",7/21/2014,i cut the cable and put an antenna on the roof in san francisco i get clear channels ota so i am lucky not to have to pay comcast or uverse or something for cable and can get great internet from monkey brains i wanted the dvr and guide capabilities so i got the roamio basicthe machine works though the first one was defective tivo customer service was great in finding the problem amazon prime was great in returningreplacing the productthe user interface is pretty good though it seems less good than the tivo interface i remember from when directv had tivo years ago on the other hand my memory might be inflating the cosmicness of the old interfaceservices for streaming on the internet are weak with amazon being the best example of one where false advertising is a kind way of describing the problem amazon instant is supported pay download not streaming while amazon prime already paid streaming is not hulu plus is supported but free hulu is just the adverts not the same free stuff you can watch on the internetyoutube actually does stream so we know streaming is technically possible with this machine btw youtube lets you cast from your computer tablet or phone to the screen plugged into the tivo this is like chromecast but is not called chromecast niceyou cannot browse the web to find a site with streaming built in footerstvcom comedycentral etc if you want to catch john oliver you have to wait until they come up on elsewhereso the machine lets you time offset recordwatch live tv ota and with a cable card if you have cable but it does not substitute for a good streaming machinethe a month for the guide is too high but the main question is whether it continues to be of value as it learns what we actually record and watch on the regular tv we will go for months to see whether we end up watching everything online or if there is any value at all in watchingrecording ota shows our viewing habits are not high volume and we dont have to see hbo or netflix shows the minute they come outprocustomer support was goodvideo quality is very goodbasic guide is good for otayoutube casting built inconamazon prime is missinganother monthly feeregular hulu missingrequires another streaming box roku sony blu ray players chromecast etc,cut cable put antenna roof san francisco get clear channels ota so lucky not pay comcast uverse something cable can get great internet monkey brains wanted dvr guide capabilities so got roamio basicthe machine works though first one defective tivo customer service great finding problem amazon prime great returningreplacing productthe user interface pretty good though seems less good than tivo interface remember when directv tivo years ago other hand memory might inflating cosmicness old interfaceservices streaming internet weak amazon best example one where false advertising kind way describing problem amazon instant supported pay download not streaming amazon prime already paid streaming not hulu plus supported free hulu just adverts not same free stuff can watch internetyoutube actually stream so know streaming technically possible machine btw youtube lets cast computer tablet phone screen plugged tivo like chromecast not called chromecast niceyou cannot browse web find site streaming built footerstvcom comedycentral etc want catch john oliver wait come elsewhereso machine lets time offset recordwatch live tv ota cable card cable not substitute good streaming machinethe month guide too high main question whether continues value learns actually record watch regular tv will go months see whether end watching everything online there any value all watchingrecording ota shows viewing habits not high volume dont see hbo netflix shows minute come outprocustomer support goodvideo quality very goodbasic guide good otayoutube casting built inconamazon prime missinganother monthly feeregular hulu missingrequires another streaming box roku sony blu ray players chromecast etc,21-Jul-14,2335,401,Electronics|Television & Video|Streaming Media Players,All Electronics,"Zuo Modern 104155 Probability Dining Chair in Gray, Sweet velour seat, Modern meets mod in the shape and metal crossing at the legs, Velour polyblend and wood materials, 250 lbs. weight capacity Key FeaturesSweet velour seatModern meets mod in the shape and metal crossing at the legsVelour polyblend and wood materials250 lbs. weight capacity SpecificationsColor:",TiVo Roamio 500 GB DVR (Old Version) -

So happy sitting here using it that even work that I have been neglecting and procrastinating over is getting done. I love the display quality and though i didn't realise I was getting a matte finish and not glossy I have nooooooo regrets matter of fact I think its the better of the two. The ability to rotate the monitor to portrait was THE selling point. It works beautifully though it takes some getting used to. Its also easy to do. With none of the adjustments do you have to press a button or release anything just pull up and down, or twist the base or rotate the display. Calibrating for your preference is great in that you have presets that you can choose from depending on movie, text, standard, etc etc. OR which is soooo cool you can predetermine in what preset you want to use for which ever software you are using so you don't have to manual change. So once I am using a movie player it switches, if I am using my graphic software it switches. Love that!! The only thing I think others might mind but i don't is that it takes up more space that than most monitors today.

A2PREU4LOFQRB1,B00DKTOZTU,Fishing Fool,"[0, 0]",0.0,I purchased this because my case is a very low profile 1U design so I needed a very low profile HSF. Not only that but I needed one with a built-in heatpipe which this one has. I also needed it to be fairly quiet. The Zalman HSF satisfies all three requirements. I'm using this on a 95W AMD CPU and it's working well so far. I've set my smart fan controller to keep the CPU temperature between 50C - 60C. At idle the fan spins at around 2000 rpm.

A3BHSG5R5NGKWK,B00CAKD6LI,T. Sweny,"[0, 0]",0.0,"This is an excellent buy. I am very happy with this monitor so far. I have only had it going for about 4 hours and it did overclock to 96 hz. It looks much better at 96 and no eye strain. The color is very good, but I do need to adjust it some. It was very bright when I first turned it on so, I did have to turn brightness down. The monitor I purchased from Stylebang on Amazon is perfect. There are no dead or stuck pixels and no light bleed. The stand that many are complaining about is adequate. The monitor will be solid if you have a decent computer desk that isn't wobbly or moves when you bump it, or as another reviewer had said ""Unless You Punch Your Monitor"".  I was very hesitant to buy this product until I had read several hundred reviews and visited several web sites and even then I was apprehensive until it arrived and I hooked it up. This seems to be the favorite high deff monitor from Korea and it is for sure a favorite of mine so far. The case looks fine and doesn't look cheap or shabby as I have seen in many reviews that knit pick.My neighbor purchased a $1200 monitor that looks no better than this one. After looking at mine closely he remarked that ""He wished he had bought  one like it"" His has 2 bright green pixels that do show up and some minor light bleed, and they will not do anything about it because they say those are allowable defects.As for speakers, I don't use them because I have external speakers. I never understood why someone would want to listen to tiny monitor speakers when they have all these Great sound cards to choose from and really great stereo speakers. My computer also doubles as a high quality stereo.The stand does tilt and it is stiff, so be careful and get a good hold up and down ""not on the screen"" when you tilt it. It isn't something I will need to do often so, it's no problem. There are video's on you tube and others on ways to fix this if you can't live with it. This was a great buy! I recommend this product, however I don't have any idea what you would have to do if you needed warranty work. I personally would buy from Stylebang on Amazon again.

I've used ipad 3/ipad mini/ surface rt.  they are all ok, I tend to use this WAY more than i used any of those.  I still use my macbook retina 15 to do anything with major typing (like this review) but i use this for absolutely everything else.  Here are some of my points of interest.1) do yourself a favor and spend the extra $ for the 64 gb.  32 is just to small after you install all your windows apps.2) get an otg (on the go) cable so you can plug in external usb devices. i got this on amazon (Cable Matters (2-Pack) Micro-USB 2.0 On-The-Go (OTG) Adapter)3)the 64 gig one i bought does not have the recovery file on a micro sd card.  it is partitioned on the device itself.  I made a bootable usb stick with windows 8.1 x32 and used the otg cable to usb hub, with a keyboard and mouse and booted from the usb device (after i installed the latest bios on the factory install).  I wiped the device completely clean ie removed all partitions and installed a fresh copy of windows 8.1  I then installed all the newest drivers from the driver page from asus.  Its working better than from when i used the factory install.  It had problems waking up and now does not.  I also now have 15 gb free rather than 3.4)i love civ 5.  i've installed it on this and it WILL RUN!  the touch version works great HOWEVER you must lower most setting to low or the game will crash because it will run out of ram as this only has 2gb (1.8 usable after video card uses what it needs).  Clean windows 8.1 uses around .6-.9 gb with nothing running.  It will also run Skyrim at around medium low settings!5) make sure to update the wacom drivers to the latest version (720-9 as of time of writing this) and do the FULL touch calibration via wacom in the control panel.  This Asus version has 81 calibration points. That's significantly more than the 25-points on the generic tablet pc version.  This version also makes the pen work better near the edges as well.6) the camera is ok, my iphone takes better pictures though.7) the latest bios (210) IS touch enabled, you dont need a keyboard to select things.8) The office it comes with is just a key for home and office 2013 in the box.  ( you can sell this on eBay if you choose for around 70$ and recoup some of your cost)9)Battery life is around a full day of lite use.  i can leave this off the charger for a few days and it'll still have plenty of battery to work.HOWEVER charging it takes a really long time from 0-100$ like a 2-3 hours)10) wireless is pretty good on this, it sees my 2.4 and 5ghz asus rt-68 router.11) screen is bright and crisp, the resolution is pretty good for the size, however i update this dpi to 125 to make it easier to use my finger to touch and select things. 1080p videos play smoothly and perfectly.12) the speakers are on the back of it and its pretty loud for the size of the tablet.

A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,B00E9O6C96,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[1, 2]",0.5,"The FiiO X3 audio player offers superb sound. I can't say enough good things about the audio quality on good headphones and the added enjoyment that I have derived from listening with this device. However all of the high end, made in China personal audio players seem to have a somewhat home grown, garage brewed character, which may be the case seeing as these are niche products made in relatively small quantities. The X3 for example has a very retro form factor and interface, more like something from 2004 than 2014. That said, where it counts is in the playback, and for playback this is an amazing system. Its ability to output both line and digital audio, and to double as a outboard DAC makes it well worth the money for anyone who wants the best sound on the go.All that said, the current FW3 firmware update for the FiiO X3 (FW3.0 as of the date of this review) has a number of serious file display and sorting problems. It is very much a work in progress, and a lot more work is needed.The file sorting and other issues with the FW3 upgrade are:Problem No 1: Album cover does not display at correct ratio. Album covers display with the left and right sides cropped off. The covers should display re-sized at the pixel width of the display, anchored to the top, not fill the frame top to bottom with the sides cropped off.Problem No 2: Album sort mixes separate albums/folders into single listings. In the following example, the three titles are separate albums with distinct titles located in separate folders.Bellini - I Puritani - Caballé - MutiBellini - I Puritani - Callas - di Stefano - SerafinBellini - I Puritani - Pavarotti - Freni - MutiNevertheless, the file system lists all the tracks from these albums in one listing, all jumbled together, as though they were all the same album. The player lists ALL the tracks for ALL three albums under a single title:Bellini - I PuritaniThe string length for parsing album titles probably needs to be increased to the maximum number of chars to allow the correct identification of these three albums as being individual albums, even though each album title begins with the same words.Problem No. 3: Track name sort does not recognize and sort for special chars and leading chars. In the following example the three albums should sort as follows._MixBluesJazzWorldInstead, the file system ignores the leading underscore character and sorts the albums as:BluesJazz_MixWorldProblem No. 4: Artist listing does not pick up all albums with the same artist name. On my X3 for example, I have six albums with the ID3v2 field ""ARTIST"" reading ""Cecilia Bartoli"". However only three of those albums appear in a sort by artist listing.Problem No. 5: Documentation. I have been buying electronic products made in Asia for over forty years. Over that time I have seen and read a lot of poor and frequently tortured English. The PDF documentation for the FiiO X3 is the worst English language documentation that I have ever seen. Many parts of it are almost incomprehensible. The English is VERY POOR, with many grammar errors, wrong word choices, and sentences that frequently are almost gibberish. The documentation needs to be re-written completely by someone who knows how to speak and write English properly.Problem No. 6: The character set used to display titles in English does not include many special characters used in various other European languages that may also be used in words or names of song titles, even though the interface is in English. Songs or album names using any of these characters display with gibberish where a letter should be. The software should use the full ANSI or ASCII character set for all European languages.Problem No 7: There is no way to select a folder or group of folders to play, or to add an entire folder or group of folders to ""Favorites"". There is no way to toggle ""Play"" when highlighting an artist name.Problem No 8 (A minor typo): When accessing ""Info"" about a track the word ""Bitrate"" has a leading space before ""B"" causing the word to indent in. The space should be removed. No big deal, but it shows a lack of attention to detail and makes the product look amateurish.Problem No. 9: The icon interface should not be spread over two screens. There is no reason, for example, for the ""Favorites"" and the ""Browse Files"" icons to be repeated twice on two separate screens. All the icons should be slightly smaller and all on one screen.The audio quality of the X3 is superb. But the software and interface is very amateurish. The cheapest Android smartphone has a music player with better controls and sort options than the X3 has. And of course even the cheapest Android smartphone music player has play-lists, which the X3 lacks completely. The superior audio quality of the X3 is the only reason to tolerate the very poor interface design and attention to software detailing. I love the audio. And I tolerate the interface. If FiiO can just bring a better game to the software side of its player it will be a solid all around winner for anyone wanting top quality portable audio.",4,"Superb audio, great output options, retro form factor, amateurish software interface.

The low profile means it's easier to slip my Kindle Fire into a bag or purse without any added bulk. I will say, the side grips are a little awkward - they are quite stiff at first, and it makes it difficult to get in and out of the Kindle. I'm also worried that with too much prying, they will bend over time and be rendered useless. So far, so good, though.

A2RE6BXK6RGJ6G,B00HWMPRKW,robert,"[1, 1]",1.0,"I started back in the day with the Samsung infuse as my first introduction to Androids and haven't looked back since. The majority of time spent on a PC is primarily entertainment and I've found Androids to give the most seamless interactive environment for the majority of casual PC users while taking their interactions with their phones to levels once only dreamed of in Science Fiction .A little backgrounds,  I am a A+ certified with a advanced degree in Business Management as well as Network Administration.  To say I'M partial to Samsung is  equivalent to saying I have a preference to live. I've indoctrinated my entire  family into the Samsung family. Start I'm with the infuse, I've gone through the entire Galaxy line of phones and tablets for myself and my family.  From the s2, s3, s4, s5 phones to multiple Tab 2 7.0, tab 2,10.1, the note 10.1 the note 8.0 and now the note pro 12.2(my favorite so far. Right now with my wife, two kids and myself we have 2 S5 and 2 S4 phones and a note 8.0 Wifi, an 8.0 note At&t cellular, and a Galaxy Note 10.1 and my personal Tablet the note pro 12.2.  This list doesn't onclude the smart TV's ;Blue Ray Players EtcNow that I've exposed my strong personal bias towards Samsung, I have to tell you that the Pro 12.2 is beyond most any other Tablets you've worked with. This has the closest thing you'll find to MICROSOFT OFFICE  installed on any android tablet.  The large screen and docking capabilities to use with an external keyboard is finally  practical.  Not to mention the incredible graphics,  the ability to run not just split windows, but four windows that you can adjust the size for a more practical functionality.  Then there is the capability to link different programs together so for example you can open your Email App and your Calender/appointment  screen with one click allowing common tasks to be completed more efficiently.  I could go on and on about the benefits of this tablet,  however,  someone seriously looking for the best, and aren't scared off by the price tag will be in a state of euphoric bliss after getting this tablet.As I've mentioned extensively, hands down there isn't any better phone or tablet than Samsung's. I've played with a few others and unfortunately for a short time my kids fell into the peer pressure of having to have an Apple.
