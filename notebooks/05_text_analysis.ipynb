      "- Got this unit real fast and came in a box wrapped in plastic wrap lol. But hey was all there and not damaged. Easy to assemble and looks and feels great, I had a couple minor issues with this thing you can view on the youtube page if you like to see it. But overall not bad!  http://youtu.be/4RoQHzo-C9k?list=UUZlPl1F9XVcDu12wZ7L1pJw\n",
      "- I have used many headphones before, so I have a very good idea of what headphones need to sound like.Plantronics is a great headphones:Sound quality is great the bass is very good for a small Bluetooth headphones.Fit factor: The headphones fits very nicely and snugly I do very intensive workouts with it.Battery life: is not the best but it is amazing comparing to the size of the headphones. (The charging case is a great edition to make sure your headphones are charged while in your bag)Connectivity: it is easy to connect and pair with your phone, I love the ability to pair to 8 devices.After all:It is a very good headphones, and yes I do recommend it over many other Bluetooth headphones on Amazon. The price is not bad for the great sound quality the headphones offer.\n",
      "- Beware.. there is no line out for the aux so that means you cant listen to cds or the radio from a different sound system. Its only a aux in which means you can only hook phones or mp3 players to the memorex boombox. It was my mistake not noticing this when I bought it so im not writing this review based on that. Other four stars. Its not bad at all. I wish they made boomboxes with built in batterys but oh well. The sound is actually really good and clear. The bass isnt bad its just barely present but still has a little tad bit of a thump to it. (300 violin orchestra)s bass line was left out completely but thats expected. Like i said i got this thinking it had a aux out... stupid me lol. but its ok idc. overal its good and worth your money only if your ok with no aux out.\n",
      "- Not bad except where is Windows Live Essentials and why does the calculator as well as any other start screen accessory have to take up the entire screen. Also why is dual or multi-booting with other OSes a pain, since I can't just install Linuxmint after Windows and install grub2 to the MBR like I was in the past with Windows 7. Microsoft really went out of their way to make this the most unpleasant and unfriendly operating system in terms of getting along with UNIX/LInux even it does work fine on a Mac because this operating system make installing a multi-boot system a pain with anything other than Microsoft products.\n",
      "- I bought this camera for one thing only... waterproof. I am not a diver. I only need to take photos of the kids in the water parks and in the pool. First time I used this camera in the pool, I got water in the lens. This practically ruined all my photos due to the water swishing around the lens and causing blurry photos. It wasn't even ONE meter deep. As if that was not bad enough, a few weeks later the whole screen started to fog up really badly, and obstructed my view of the shots. Now both the lens AND the screen fog up. Its a shame, as otherwise, this seems like a good camera with plenty of capabilities and takes pretty decent shots. If you need waterproof, avoid the Nikon AW110. You are better off trying some other brand.\n",
      "- This is a 27” 1080P monitor.In the box you will find:Monitor with standPower adapter and cableHDMI cableDisplayPort cableUSB 3.0 upstream cable (enables the USB port on the monitor)Drivers and documentation mediaQuick setup guideProduct and safety information guideUnlike most regular monitors it has the following built-in devices:Full HD Webcam (2.0 mega-pixel)Dual digital microphone (Omni-directional)Speakers (2 x 5.0W)USB3.0 Hi-Speed Hub (with 1 USB upstream port and 2 USB downstream ports)The monitor provides the following connectivity:1 VGA connector2 HDMI(MHL) connector1 DisplayPort (version 1.2a)2 USB 3.0 ports - Downstream1 USB 3.0 port - Upstream1 Headphone out/ Microphone-in combo jackRight away I noticed that the stand only lets the monitor tilt, there is no height or swivel adjustment. You do get standard VESA mounting points so you can change the stand if you'd like but it should have been included. The webcam is a fixed-focus camera but I'd have preferred an auto-focus one. My Logitech webcam from many years ago auto-focuses. The speakers are not bad, not great but not bad. The controls are touch based and not difficult to use. No complaints there and there are a lot of adjustments available.Once I got the monitor up and running I turned the brightness way down and went to work adjusting the color. I messed around with it for quite a while but generally found the picture to look too blue for my tastes. I ended up resetting the settings and getting out my Spyder 3 and calibrating the screen with that. It helped and I am generally satisfied with the color but not wowed or anything.Overall I think this would be a pretty good office monitor or a monitor for mom and pop types. It is a monitor that I'd get for my parents who primarily emails and web browses. The built in devices work well enough and when you consider the package as a whole it isn't a bad monitor.\n",
      "- Pros:Terrific IPS screenBoots from full off to logon screen in secondsSnappy performance for its specsDrop dead simple to useLots of useful appsCons:Low end keyboard and mouseTinny speakersLimited storageCan't run Windows x86 programsPrinting documents is a challengeFeedback between monitor and USB mouseOther thoughts:We're a Windows PC household, with three desktops I built and a couple of portables, so I'm comfortable around computers.  I've also had Apple computers in the past, starting with the Apple IIe in the 80s and ending with a Mac Mini a few years ago.  I have to say the Chromebase is the easiest computer I've ever set up.It is also a very nice looking unit, something of an iMac lookalike due to the stand, although definitely not the same build quality.  The Chromebase is all plastic construction, to be expected at this price point, but nicely executed.  The keyboard and mouse are budget items but I found typing on the keyboard to be pleasant enough, with good tactile response and key travel; not bad at all for a membrane keyboard.  The mouse is a cheap, lightweight thing, but it gets the job done.  The money you're paying is for the monitor.  It's a very nice, full HD IPS screen that looks terrific.  This is not your father's netbook screen.There is some assembly required but it's well documented and simple, just six screws to mount the computer to the stand.  Then all I had to do was connect the mouse, keyboard, Ethernet cable, and power.  As soon as I plugged in the power the computer booted to the logon screen in just seconds.  There was a brief, optional tutorial on the screen after logging on and then I was up and running.We network in our house using powerline adapters, and I hooked the Chromebase up to an adapter during setup for internet connectivity, then later went online with wireless to see how well that worked.  No problems with either mode, they both worked as they should.  After logging on to wireless the first time the system will automatically default to that if the wired Ethernet is disconnected.I tried all the programs that would be important to me if I didn't care about AAA gaming or fancy image editing programs.  I tested Gmail, Netflix, web searches with Google using Chrome, Outlook.com, Pandora, and a bunch of others, and everything worked just as it was supposed to with no hassle.  Netflix movies, for example, stream nicely with no stuttering.  I especially liked that I can open the Outlook Web App (OWA) to access my work email.  High-end gaming is not an option on this device but performance is surprisingly good considering the specs.  I tried a couple of the free games in the app store, like Bejeweled, and they ran fine.  I didn't experience any noticeable lags or slowdowns, but be aware that with only 2GB of RAM you won't be able to do any serious multitasking.I also tried multimedia files to see how they would play.  I ripped one of my movies to .mv4 format on my Windows desktop and transferred it to a 3.0 USB stick, then launched the movie on the Chromebase.  It played flawlessly with adequate volume, as did .mp3 music files.Speaking of volume, you can set it using both the screen menu arrows and the keyboard's dedicated volume keys.  I noticed that if I had the volume set to 100% using the screen menu there was an intermittent, high-pitched, quiet but noticeable squeal that sounded like a hardware feedback loop.  Interestingly, the noise would occur when I moved the mouse.  I found that if I lowered the onscreen volume to about 65% the noise went away (or was so low I couldn't hear it), even when I maxed out the volume using the keyboard.  I experimented with another USB mouse and got the same results. Then I tried two different wireless mice, one Bluetooth and the other RF.  Neither produced the squeal and they worked just fine with all volumes set to max.  The moral of the story: if you get one of these plan on investing in a wireless mouse.  Oh, and don't expect much from the speakers, they sound like what you would typically get on a laptop, with no bass to speak of.  Sound is greatly improved when using headphones or external powered speakers, of course.I was curious to see how Google Docs would handle Office documents so I experimented with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  All three opened up fine from the USB stick but I was not able to edit the PowerPoint file, only view it.  Nor could I launch the presentation.  One Excel file was a relatively simple one with no fancy charts, but it did have several formulas like autosum which worked as they should.  However, a second spreadsheet with objects inserted (checkboxes) wouldn't display the objects.  A free app in the store offers a simple workaround if you need more editing power, Word Online, which is bundled with Excel Online and PowerPoint Online, but even Excel Online can't display embedded objects.  If you have to create more sophisticated documents you're going to have to use a Windows or Apple PC.  While the Google Docs are saved to Google Cloud the Office documents are saved to OneDrive so you'll need an account for that if you want to use the Online Office apps.  There is also native support for .pdf files built into the operating system, and all the .pdf files I tested maintained their proper formatting.My other complaint with documents on the Chromebase is how printing is handled.  You have to either buy a printer that is \"Cloud Ready\" or connect to a Windows PC that has a \"Classic\" printer attached to it.  This solution will be workable if you're using the Chromebase in a household that already has Windows PCs like mine but it won't work for households that just want one simple computer to handle basic computing needs.  For those households it's either buy a \"Cloud Ready\" printer or don't print at all.I was curious to see if the USB 3.0 port on the side of the monitor (there also are three USB 2.0 ports in the back) could power something bigger than a thumb drive so I hooked up a USB 3.0, 500GB Seagate external drive.  It took only a moment to launch, and all of the files stored on it were accessible.  In addition to the ones I mentioned earlier I was also able to view .bmp and .jpg image files.  By the way, I found a \"File\" app preinstalled that takes me right to the file tree; very easy to navigate if you need to go there.I've been using the Chromebase exclusively since I got it while my Windows desktop sits idle, and I have to say that all-in-all this is a very nice unit.  I'm giving it 4 stars even though it isn't perfect, simply because you're getting so much value for the money.  I would have given it a perfect score if it hadn't been for the feedback problem between the monitor and the mouse and the difficulty with printing and handling of some documents.  Frankly, I think this computer excels at its intended use and price point.\n",
      "- I have both the HEOS 3 and the HEOS 5.  I have the 3 in my bedroom and the 5 in my living room.Getting Started - Both of these speakers were packaged very well and were easy to unpack and get started.  Both speakers come with a Quick Start guide that will get you up and running in just a few simple, easy-to-follow steps.  Basically you just plug in your speaker, download the HEOS by Denon app and you're ready to to get started.  One thing that disappointed me though was the fact that there's no actual user manual.  Aside from the simple little quick start guide, there was nothing else to refer to.  I had a few questions that I just had to figure out on my own.  There's not manual to refer to.Setup - After installing the app on my iPad and opening it up, it walked me through the setup process to add my speakers.  It was pretty simple for the most part.  I did have a tiny snag with the HEOS 5 when it had me plug my iPad into the speaker via the audio cable.  It tells you that when the light turns yellow you are to push the connect button.  My light never turned yellow.  I ended up pushing connect anyway and it connected just fine.  I got the yellow light with the HEOS 3 and it connected just fine as well.During the setup process you give each of your speakers a name, which is the name of the room that you have your device in.  So basically my speakers are name \"Bedroom\" and \"Living Room\".  This is how you choose which device you're wanting to use and what you want to do with it.The App - I really like the HEOS by Denon app.  There are several music options.  Pandora, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody and you device's music.  I love using Pandora and I also love using tunein to listen to my local radio stations.  The app will also keep a history log for you so you're able to quickly and easily select the track or station again.  From the app you're able to rename your speakers, access the EQ settings where you can change the treble and/or bass as desired, check for updates, add another device and much more.Playing Music - From the app you have 3 main tabs across the bottom of your screen.  Rooms, Music & Now Playing.  You select room to pick which speaker/room you want to play music in.  You go back and fourth easily so that you're able to play different things on different speakers.  Or, if you want you can play your music on both speakers simultaneously.  This is nice if you're the only one home and are doing housework.  My living room is downstairs and my bedroom is upstairs so I'm able to hear the music pretty much wherever I'm at.  It was a bit tricky figuring out how to group my speakers together so I could play the same thing on both at the same time.  The app tells you to \"Drag one room into another to group them\".  I kept putting my finger on one and dragging it to the other but all they would do would be to switch positions.  I finally discovered that you have to actually hold your finger on one of the rooms for a second or two prior to dragging it to the other.  Then, they were grouped together and would play the same thing.  Every now and then they will play a bit out of sync but when I skip to the next song it seems to correct itself.The Speakers - The speakers themselves look pretty nice.  The shape of them is unique but to be honest these aren't ones that would really catch my eye if I saw them in somebody else's house.  They're just not very sharp looking or and don't have anything that gives it the wow factor.  They're not bad looking, they just don't stand out.Aside from the plug-in's on the back the only other buttons on the speakers is a volume up, volume down and a mute button.  There's not even a power button.  The speakers just kinda go on stand-by and always have a blue light on indicating that it's plugged in.  This is kinda nice in the sense that you can pick up your music device at any given time and start playing music.  On the other hand, I wonder how much power it's using sitting on stand-by all the time.The HEOS 5 has a handle which is helpful for carrying.  The HEOS 3 can stand vertically like a tower or it can lay down horizontally.Sound - Over the past 7 years or so I've probably tried at least 10 different speakers.  I think the sound is really great from these speakers.  They'e both really powerful.  The HEOS 3 didn't sound as great when I was testing it out in my dining room which is very open to the rest of the downstairs.  When I put it in my bedroom I was able to hear that it's just as good as the HEOS 5.  It just sounds best in a smaller space, which is what it was designed for.  I have no complaints with the sound.  I'd say they're one of the best sounding speakers that I've used.Multiple Users - After installing the app on my iPad and figuring everything out, I had my husband put the app on his iPad as well.  As soon as he installed the app, both speakers appeared on his app immediately.  He was able to set up his own HEOS account which then allowed him to log-in to his own Pandora and other music accounts so that he could choose his own personalized music.  I can set my daughter and son up with their own accounts too.  I think having the ability to do this will come in very handy in our house.  It's nice not having to stick to just one single device.Overall, I'm quite pleased with both of these speakers.  I would highly recommend them.\n",
